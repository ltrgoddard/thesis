Force of Circumstance
Locked rigid in the memory it lies
Flaunting impermanence, knowing it may be lost
But not be changed, since intervention buys
Its small relief only at frightful cost.
And so I must carry with me, through the course
Of pale imaginings that leave no trace,
This broken, idle mill-wheel, and the force
Of circumstance that still protects the place.
The mind, I tell myself, might make it turn,
Or safer, reconstruct the rotting chute
That brought the water to it and so earn
A pretext while it turns to easy loot:
And yet, despite my hopeless indigence
I know I dare not; only my despair
Allows me to set a heron down, a tense
And watchful silence in the vacant air.
There are no fish; he will not break his stare.

Perspective from a Chalk Pit
From the green at my shoes the surge licks
Into white, twists open and up, over
Chalky scree, through stained fissures,
Stands in compact thrust, then foams
Crumbling with roots at the land’s edge. The undertow
Draws and tips skyward, hurls the wind
Shouting across my tilted face, follows
Up high silver boles, and out into green
Warmth and the startled, turning birds. Ironic
To the last, the clouds curl
Lazily, in the loose-knit distance.
These swells spring from old seas, have never
Run deep under the turf, matted with resonant
But composed urgency, and the sky’s echo.
Painters know it, weather their priming
Before green and blue rescue them and tip
Us into wind-raked skies, delighting
At their risk and our respectful pleasure.
But here, at the current’s eddy, how should I,
Knowing this and no painter, yield?
Chalk is the turf’s secret; once seen
This may blind a simple eye to green.

Before Urbino
House next to house; tree next to tree; a wall
Tokens a winding road. The air across
The distant slope is palpable with light,
A clarid flood of silence. The heavy fruit
That weighs upon the olives can’t be seen
But must be there There must be people too
Perhaps beneath the olives in the shade,
Calling to one inside the nearby house
And sending golden ripples through the air.
Such tokens are a ready currency:
And we are thus too liberal in their use
Who read a landscape so between the lines,
And take what it before us as a sign
Of what is mere conjecture. Still the light
Graces the house, and tree, and winding wall
With tranquil presence; lights upon the stone,
Shades the recumbent posture of the tree,
And leaves us silent in the singing air.

Or Would Like to Think
Sometimes in the ragged summer I would come
Here as a child feeling for the lighted revisions
Held among the brambles from their escape
In dismay or deeper reluctance. Bringing with
Me a point of departure, a small stone
Was enough as unless so clenched I should simply
Eat overripe blackberries. Here there were often ways
Of turning round or moving in soundless directions,
Shaping across to the stone a fragile space
Drawn from under the brambles. This took several
Days to collect again, and so had to be hoarded,
Marked down by the three birches from the one stump.
Such spun volumes as I drew from these thickets
Would harden, carefully, in the sunlight
On the way back and gleam softly for days;
Though sometimes I would come just to eat blackberries.

Littoral
Sand has been often called upon to play
The humbler part, remitting the rhythmic press
Of wave on wave of emblems, scooped and borne
In sweeping gestures, held, and cast away.
Too diffident to fight the mounting tides
Of rampant homily, it shifts its stance;
Water respects this frailty, but once
Incited by eloquence, it changes sides.
Victims ourselves of this same prior intent,
The obvious rebuttal of the rock
Claims our respect, to which the artless sand
Must be the antonym, and yield consent.
Derision follows: soon this pliant sand
Is emblem of our own credulity;
Only the rock will cup it in its hand,
Respect its scale, and its fine solvency.

Connoisseur at Noonday
This loose-fitting indignation, he said,
Becomes you; dismay ruffles your hair
Easily, but now without concern
For an accurate charm, and your eyes
Ornament the grain of habitual commerce
With this fervent lateral current.
He was about to comment further
One the light in her throat, and to ask
What it was over his left shoulder
That had so sharpened her breathing;
But as she had choked into a statue,
He sighed, and turned back across the autumn.
After all, there would doubtless be others.

Singing at Last
With no regret for fabric, no splayFooted running or turning in the late
Evenings, he bred his tempest up
To listen attentively towards nightfall.
So the winds grew
Within their given
Compass, no riot
As the blue deepened.
An exact twilight, whose levelled clouds
Made passage for the great winds
Between the shades. He watched often
From different points, always the same.
Alignments revealed
New obscurities, which
Towards the end he
Could almost touch.
He felt across them, simply, urging the storm
To run and so discover its full span,
From all sides, this was indeed what he
Needed above all, though he never hurried it.
He sang at last,
In a tone so
Pure, the heavens split
Compass, to darkness.

To Petrarch, on Mount Ventoux
Resent these mountains, crowding upon the sky
With soft insurgence, for they blunt the eye
With promise of distinctions never made.
Once their initial premise gains assent
We sprawl like dizzied victims in the grip
Of endless promises of, further on,
The ultimate perfection. Thus, from here
The prospect though immense is clearly partial,
Spoiled by those trees, and only just a hint
Of what’s to come, once we are higher up,
Or further on; or anyway, not here.
Yonder it lies, that matchless colour print
For which within our minds we bear the frame,
And which, debauched with wonder, we assign
To what we shall not see. Alas the pines,
The rocks and grasses--true we do you wrong
To treat you so; only the lowered gaze
Can give you life here, who do not amaze.

Without Breaking the Thread
Who cannot see will weave, and thus disperse
Across such jointed networks all delight;
Remoter tenses calibrate the scene,
Allusive orchestration of the sight.
Unravellment of this habitual weave
Must shuttle where the former mind has been.
Do not despise this fanciful reverse;
It leads us back to what we had not seen.

Surface Measures
Only children walk along the ladders. Others
Climb against them carrying paint
Or a screwdriver and thus near vertical
Ladders are purposes which must be sustained by reasons
Like the loose tile or any well-founded excuse
For angles and serious perspectives. To dance
Is only permitted where banality is assured
Protecting the innocent from prosody or the chance skip
With near vertical music. The prone ladder
Is likewise a danger to probity and decorum
The beginning and the end on equal terms
Tempting to a savoured awareness of passage. Yet
Ignorant of mines and the azure the child’s foot
Explores the latent matrix above
This brilliant music curving away
Across to the sea and the land where oranges grow.

And Afterwards
A loving feather in his eyes, he takes
The broken hillside at a scramble, makes
The ridge and stumbles upright. Drawing his nets
Of snagged recession with him, which he lets
Fall at his feet, he contemplates a catch
Full of a life that shows he’s met his match
But which he holds still, poised in one large sweep
That shines like copper as it reaches deep
Into the distance. Then it breaks away,
Leaving the open surface of the day
Without a ripple; drains the steady air
And smooths the image of his eager stare.
He cannot cross this ridge, or even turn
To see what lies beyond; for he would learn
That his gull eyes had next to take a town
Burnished with small affections and set down
Too deep for dredging. Here the tangles lives
Are pinned in secrecy by anxious wives.
And various railways. No heroic gaze
From his high vantage point can draw this maze
Even for a desperate moment to his feet.
There I must leave him, who descend to meet
More than he knew; perhaps some god will see
My parting thanks, and root him as a tree.

Insurrection
Between the disorderly grasses and the straggling parsley
And willowherb remaining from older encounters
And large nameless leaves, I follow, obedient.
Firmly the path ferries the moving mind
Across the shifting perspective, towards and beyond
The uncertain birches; sets the trophies forth
Of my intending, long with slanting shadows.
Yet here where the paths intersect it is suddenly warm;
Evening gathers the threads of contradiction,
The parsley glistens, and the willowherb spurts with fire.

The Whetstone
A sudden swirling of new-fallen leaves
Rises in crisp pursuit; the instant, tigerish,
Is tightly wound and luminous; subsides
Fiercely dissolving through the splintered air.
The image, etched, remains, invites surmise:
Each jagged leaf threatens the wind and autumn,
Stabs at their pallid range, and rips to shreds
Our hoarded melancholy’s aimless charm.
Such moments, though, are prood against abuse;
Even the image cannot hold the air
Standing with tawny pride against the wild
Abrasions of the flashing autumn leaves.
The whetstone of the mind is thus revealed
In sudden starts that must be taken when
They serve; the leaves lie spent upon the ground,
A dozen razors, keen, without a sound.

Quittance
Such swollen hands she
Had, the old one, wrenching
Her purse, dredging for
Coins; her face folded
In fixed unconcern, the
Fingers only speaking and
So terribly swollen.

Other Dimensions
The rutted pathway winds between high banks
Obliquely, shelving against the eager slope
That side-slips down, to where I can just see
The elderflower below, and hear the sounding
Of gleaming water. Through the slender trunks
Which rooting staunch into the cloven earth
Reach gravely for the sky, I catch along
The gilded crest, hints of a lavish sun.
Blankly the pathway, shored against the grade
Pursues its course athwart the opposing trumpetings
That press by implication on its banks,
And rise to whirling echoes in the sap
Of solemn, soundless laughter. We who accept
The promise of arrival, may afford
A wry smile to the mocking elderflower,
Safe between the banks that keep up us from its power.

With Pearls for Eyes
Old men may sit in ruins of the mind
But may not weep. The onset of regret
May turn catlike upon itself, and stalk
Adroitly across the landscape that is set
Before each careful paw, but may not stop
To stare in light of day upon the face
Of human sorrow. Movement is a cat’s
Own elegant advertisement, of grace
Whose feline music runs before and after;
If he should once catch sight of this old man
Which unchecked tears watching the falling rain
And fumbling through his past to make it scan,
A cat would lose the shaping of the phrase
Transfixed by sadness that was not his own,
And lost both to himself and to his master
Within another’s ruin, turn to stone.

Early Yesterday Morning
Take light from this, now a deep
Green, that I have not moved
From where I was, tied down
To its brightly burnished cleat. Over
Among the trees there is still
Random shadow, for all who
Care to gather it up, song
From the endless running. Yet to stand
Is progress, mast-like, to the place
Where the anchorage affords voyaging.
The waters are closing over my head.

Given, to Both
Once granted the periwinkles, virtue
Fined to a processional streaming,
Gravely the scudding clouds climb
Into this crystalline sphere.
The walking herbalist’s angry stare
After such virtual translation,
Grave too, over the shattered husks,
Swerves, met by the sun.
Instance, he mutters, disbelieving
The pastoral eloquence of the wild
Man’s garden, will surely wither
Even so rampant a kind:
He cannot see that the one
Given these high constellations, can
Like no tourist along his path,
See once into and across
What he knows as the dust mapped
In the palm of his hand. Ask
More of either, and the clouds
Will snatch them both into the burning sun.

Responsibilities
Afterwards a light mist came down over the trees
Though it was still only morning; across the fields
Of glistening turned earth, the single elms
Dissolved into clumps of chromatic outline, and the rooks
Grew distant. The morning dripped in the hedges, where
The grasses sagges with moisture, heavy with bloom;
The elms were grey now, and the rooks were silent,
And it was still morning across the breathing fields.
I could have wished it away, the mist, as iridescence
Is an elusive enhancement that we must look on with care
If the elms are not to be damaged, and the sudden gate
To carry more than it can bear. For the further distance
Is no longer ours, and the vanished horizon no longer
Marks off what exists over there from the willingly possible.
Elms surrender precision and grow trustful; this free confidence
Is precious, and will support a brilliant afternoon.

Le Verger Ardent
Men have been drunk in orchards, from the air
Of rich fermented purpose in the trees;
Ordered abundance has in thought alone
Subdued a mind spent on such dreams as these.
As leaden sunlight gathers in deep pools
About the laden boughs, and the grass knee-high
Wanders in contemplation through the shade
Purple with juices from the teeming eye,
The essence of this pendent citadel
Is sure against the ravenous assault
Of birds or boys, who sport no talisman
To break the spell with any jutting fault.
The deftest fruit is thus the surest fact
And purest fiction; firm upon the tree
With such intense assurance that the hand
May never reach it that would set it free.

Not Kite-flying Weather
Listen he said to me, and I
In turn say to you, to the rising
Volutes of the afternoon, gather
In the hand and carefully these bright
Sprays from its tranquil weather.
So: listen into the momentary light
At the day’s centre, for this is no time
For the flying of kites, lifting to hover
Across a changeable season and se e
Our horizons on intricate fire.
Rather withold a keener weight,
And setting the afternoon to trace
Its weather across the wind’s moving,
Listen, from within this open space
To the bright sprays growing.

Landfall
If we had been the builders of this bridge
It might have been otherwise; but now
How can we take the bridge without the road
Which runs above it, or the running stream
That glides beneath its span? A confluence
Of such strong motives must defeat the stone
To any casual eye, swayed by the force
Intending hither only to pass hence.
No archness points its claim, no fine excess
Of care was lavished on its balustrade;
Its outline spare, its service is its cause,
As if no traveller should be delayed
By ornament, still less the floating weed.
And yet the fields have fruited at this point;
The rising swell that cups its motive, twists
Out of the turn a light that neither has,
Tied to the shade that all the water shares
Beneath its mellow rind. Firm as a pear
It rests, triumphant; I shall go and stand
Upon its stones and celebrate the land.

For Someone Else
We shrug too quickly
At sailing from islands,
Leaving across this stretch
Of blithe water, risings
We cannot hold or ignore.
Even such a commotion
As this, washing the darkened
Shore, is sharpened by lighted
Windows that do not concern us;
We shrug too quickly.

Getting One’s Bearings
And if the air moved sweetly through the trees,
Turning the leaves to smoke along the spare
And easy branches, he would fight the mist
That filled the spaces he had wanted bare.
Spindles, they were to his most acid gaze,
Holding the void between their avid lines,
Hinging their spaces outward from the stem,
Erect or broken, spars or angled tines.
He set each spinning tightly on its stock,
Unlacing the fine community of shade
Which lay among the leaves and sweetly stirred
Between the lights the moving air had made.
A pivotal obsession; yet he felt
Mocked by the nodes his modern life had grown:
Transformer stations, lathes, a locked routine
Barren of shapes a man might call his own.
And so he came as often as he could
To fight the woods while drawing on their ease;
He brought the sweetness in his eager eyes,
Which spun like spindles through the smoking trees.

Fisherman in August
Gestures of intention meet
Over his head; a turbulence
Belied by the still air
But known in the slipped phrasings
Of the river, by his feet.
The curve rests, unspoken;
The warmth would persuade that
These fine eddies refine
A stillness, living because
Relevant: eloquent fixity. Thus
Predatory, the sun twitches
Gestures to definitions,
Dried to extension. A supple fiction:
Containing his own cooler momentum,
He watches his float.

Mining for Flint
Below this fronded heath the casualness
Is closer packed and waiting for the blow
From the moon’s incisive stare. Down to the black
Siliceous lode this glacial calm makes slow
Deliberate descent; the night’s attack
Upon the branching daylight’s understress.
Flake upon flake is struck without a spark
Of feeling or remorse; a razor edge
Won by indifference on the chipping-floor
From life that hardened into this black ledge.
The earliest miners can have felt no more,
With shallow lamps in such unchanging dark
Thus to have shaped their tools; it is the moon
Whose burning nonchalance can show us this,
Flaking the limits of our old concern
To durable precision. If we miss
The understress that made these miners burn,
We now have means to make such darkness noon.

Quasi al Tocco
Here at the top of the bell-tower, these
Great brazen pots are basking
Contemptuously, in the sun. Their voices
Gather round pulleys, sag, and vanish.
Even the stillness resounds
With their presence, dislocating
The scale so that we feel
Compressed, into half-stature.
Pick a fight then, I say, stand
Firm against so bland a carapace,
These pools of grave concern which
Dispense periodically their knowingness.
Even the stillness resounds
With their presence, the struts
Braced against the resonance;
The brickwork is drenched with it.
Pitted, they are and bloomed over
With the wind’s greening and a fine fret
From the great mould. It takes the tongue
Around one’s teeth and palate to find them.
Without those casual ropes
A man could warm himself
At these most modest fires,
So nearly their own centres.

But Will Not Scatter
We brought our candles from beneath the sea
Where aureoles of coral used to shimmer
With unexplored delights, and the far anger
Of surf was silvered by lucidity.
For even when alone in silent ways
Among the fluted shadows of the ocean,
The steadfast flame that burned with slow concision
Had shed no beams our eyes could paraphrase.
Now we have neon lighting, and know well
That candles gild but will not scatter darkness;
We have no use for submarine excursions,
The wreckage of our past lies as it fell.
And if the power fails and it should be
That we should take a candle to the cellar
To mend the fuse, the murmur from the boiler
And broken chairs will stir the memory.
A silver wire restores our certainty.

Towards September
And the July bird
returned to the branch
dipped under his weight
the price was just
the July lupins
remained blue
September cannot take more
than there is to July
decorum has no recompense
and need of none
nor breathing space
for the round stone
And the storm uprooted the big tree
lying in the driveway
thrashed the green air
nakedly curious
delighted lupins
ran into the sun
Recognise this: follow
the round stone
take what the bird
offers to spare
or otherwise
wait for September

Passing the Primary School
Their voices run like railings down the street;
The mean refusals and the sudden near
Clatter of tinsel in the septic air
Reminds me how I am the stranger there.
They snatch the winter sunlight in their hands
To map the paving-stones; beyond them stands
Myself, seen from a distance, just a tame
Hulk stranded by the ebb tide of their game.
How motionless I am required to be!
The sounds converge and scatter, and I see
Their brightness glitter. Still their greedy lives
Drain my nostalgia, sever it with knives
Like children’s voices, running down the street.
Remorseless innocence--I cannot meet
This cruelty with kindness; as I scrape
My passage past, they stand, with mouths agape.

Ad Parnassum
Coming to the edge of a large wheatfield
Gleaming with improbable silences, sprung
With seed-cases declining under the wind’s
Order and shadow, to hear any clock
Strike a far hour while the signpost
At the corner is still announcing the four
Timeless miles to a plausible end,
Is an encouraging accident. From
This point the sowing can be inferred
And the further edge of the combine harvester,
Soon due for a thorough overhaul.
Grandsons and nephews of those inscribed
Names in the trimmed, more primitive grass
Round the clock’s tower, will continue
To buy their bread four plausible miles
From this point. Which is by no
Means the only ground from which
These slow seed-cases can draw the sun
Into their tensed riches; but
Four miles further lies the edge of the world.

Even in Broad Daylight
There is a silence in the whitebeam’s poise
Which wards off increment and all assay;
Its lithe deliberation holds a pause
That no expense of purpose can defray.
The context that would take its glowing tufts
Of agile green to be a mannered pose
Is thus disarmed; the web of silence sifts
These costly patterns that the mind bestows.
But if we cannot read, still we can see
What stands before our image-coining eyes,
Enter the stillness, let the sunlight play
With close ascription and no wild surmise.
Enclosed within the tree’s own equipoise
We watch it furl the limits of the day.
Distinct it stands, and this we cannot use;
It cannot mean the thing it cannot say.

Along Almost Any River
It has converted to its own purposes
My loose sense of absence, twisting
With its vapid curvatures the mind’s exclusion
Into awareness of declivities and the waterfowl.
For several hours, therefore, having neither strength
Nor a rival accuracy, I have walked
In reluctant indenture along the bank,
Exercising the faculties in the forms of compassion.
And why should I now, simply out of weakness,
Keep open house to the spurious decision
Of swans and their indifferent currents? To ask
Is not to refute, but a kind of knowledge;
That the struggle will be elsewhere, not fluent, but a locked
And stammering combat between divided geologies.
Here at the source it is the riven fault
That the water will spring from, floating the lucent swans.

Return Journey
Untwist this furze
From my hair, this
Tilted brightness
Flecking the dark sea.
And do not fear my
Spiny hands, no stiffer
Than eye can tell, ringing
Their clamoured tones.
I have salt on
This rock for both,
I will be kind
As the green moss.
When will this burning cease?

Home Grown
It draws the mind, this notion: planting
Seeds in our certainty that they
Will sprout avidly from our intentions,
Thrive in the grit of our expectancy.
Their singleness affords confidence,
As these scarred pods strike roots
Downwards and through our dubious motives
To the sustenance we cannot reach
But hope breathlessly is there. Another
Plant achieved: the mind expands
In this new space, sets hazards
Of concern about each shining bud.
That every stage finally evades
The mind’s motions, reaching out
For more space than we knew
Was there, we admit, facing the open flower.

Balkan Music
It is perhaps some violence in the air
That steals fulfilment from the distant hills
And gelds the searching gaze, so that both hang
In glittering suspension in the turgid noon.
A casual glance will never reach those slopes,
Refracted by the sullen-brooding haze
And then turned loose to wander with the rest;
And so in such a land, as with our sight,
We rarely go but rather wander, blind
From optical exhaustion. Trees loom
Out of this maze, complete with twigs and shade
And just as soon are swallowed by the light.
We trust the track, a lifeless skeleton
Picked clean and blanched by facing too much sky,
To formulate progression from our daze;
And do not look too hard, for fear that we
Should glimpse between those hills the open sea.

Damp
What he was doing, rummaging among the willows
Now seems hard to explain; regarding
The crowfoot from several angles, paying
No attention to the damp. I thought at first
He must be a collector, of insects perhaps,
As he often seemed to be following something
Through the air with his eyes, or along the surface
Of the water. But he had no equipment, and never
Seemed to have caught anything, or have tried
To do so. When he finally disappeared,
An odd impression of unattached vehemence
Hung like a fine mist over the bank,
As I regarded the crowfoot, from several angles.

In Praise
Shaken down from the crest I
Recall the wide-open sounding
Fragments are all around; hear
Them jostle, like shed leaves
Climbing the headland
The breath comes short
Thrift turns evenly on
Its mounded tufts
With a fragment in each hand
I lean into the wind, setting
Bright clouds among the gulls
And rocks jammed into their sockets
Any fool can be
A martyr like this
So I shall come
Just for the view
Set them down, both pieces
Close but not touching each
Other’s shadow, move casually
Away as if without feeling
Turn instead to
The drifting sea, playing
With fire. Here
Look, and rejoice

Genius Loci
A vestige of delight in transience
Lies in the pause across a country stile,
Which shapes the tangle of the hedge to sense
And sharpens the random path to single file.
Thus knotted to the ground, this pure design
Intrinsic in the interlocking grain
Of weathered wood, projects a figured line
To which the hedge provides a flawed refrain.
No wind can ruffle this urbane device
Mortised into the landscape, nor can snow
Clog with a fine-spun silence its precise
Interstices, where lichens already grow.
And if our pleasure seem a passing mood,
And, as the season broadens into spring
The stile’s heraldic note sound over-shrewd
Among the profuse delights the hedges bring,
The lichen will assure us that the crux
Is not immune, and that the ordered space
That intermits the sentimental flux
Is rooted in and so defines the place.

Over Here
And still that further
Light, not far out
But there, across
Our lost spaces.
Fare forth with
Sightings, then; set
Over what still remains,
Limits. Only now
Will light kindle
There, and no further:
Just beyond our
Taut admissions.
Here is where there
Is, this shaft
Of light, seen
Through open limits.

Resins from Smoke
This tight courtyard, dividing the afternoon’s
Resins from smoke inching through the arcades,
Dilates the expectancy of music or at least
Of some striking event. Why otherwise
Such granular distinctions across the shafts
Barbarous with choice nonchalance? The well
Disused now, guards more fiercely
The shrivelled ironwork and rounder memories
Scored in the stone. Acrid to the mind
The smoke burns along gravel-edged limits
At the thickening resins; neither the music
Nor the striking event will resist this erosion.
Among these calibrated prophecies of the bone
This is a place to remember the past,
Or perhaps for a blind, suppliant hatred.

Misfortunes or Ideas
He was convinced that larches were effete
Trees, since to admire them was to parade
Rather too obviously a discriminating mind
Exploiting its own diffidence. She herself
When that evening, standing under the larches
He reluctantly admitted thinking it so,
Could not refuse to agree; since to find
Such a point of view intelligible, is already
To have capitulated to it. Yet as his arm
Tightened, she made a tacit condition:
The admiration of larches. And saw assent
Stirring the pupils of his admiring eyes.

Snow is Expected
Roofing of violence covers that space,
Quick-featured with omissions, which
I know as mine. Maybe tomorrow
It will snow heavily, as I expect.
Taxed to a new collapse, the air
Will starve tactfully: no gold
Here, for silence is the most
Colloquial of ambient furies.
Such suave descent is always admirable
In darkness or through whatever passes
As fine bone-structure, here or elsewhere.
So I too must be more discreet,
May not afford to stay, as absence
At the finish is quite clearly usual.
The roofing will thicken still; but the white
Spaces at least will force no special claim.

Times Trans-shifting: for Robert Herrick
’To Lutes of Amber’--the venturesome musician
Who might attempt a study in this mode
Would quickly choke on such a brittle fare.
A sounding-board needs grain and temper, needs
A latent sympathy for vibrant tone;
The tensile curve of wood, fraught with suspense
Looks to transmit this grain upon the air
And throw the curving lamina abroad.
Thus docile to the changing touch, it has
No inner life, but only what may be
Writ in the mind beyond it.
Amber lutes
Are not such willing instruments, content
To lend their urgency to any cause.
Their wood the essence of a former age,
Their sound compacted in the golden glow
Within their aromatic shapes, would seem
Too rich, to use who never took our music
Near, but in smaller doses, over intervals.
To contemplate a sound so rare, complete
Within its glowing moment: this would seem
Denied to us who have such need of time.

The Hazel Tree
A spike of bugle with quiet florets
Blue between green in dank mosses
Glossy, and growing in a shaded plain
Rises, articulate turret, by the hazel
Tree. Present and correct, ready
For inspection.
See here
Shall I blow a note scored for trumpet
Set in the key of D major
With green ground-bass? From the battlements
This may unlock, set loose
The right response: officers are meant
To be obeyed; fix bayonets,
Senses quicken, without question
Reflex action . . . But there is always
The hazel tree; pause and reflect
Correct ready for inspection,
Not impaled on action.
Pattern, not movement,
Plane and shaded, then, blue upon green
Interlinear gloss in two languages,
Tongues and palates growing moss
In the rock beside the stream
Of fluid discourse reflecting pools . . .
But there is always the hazel tree.
Pause and reflect; correct ready
For inspection: bugle, in moss,
Rising, remember, beside the hazel
Tree.

From an Eminence
What have these hills to offer to the mind
Caught up with a nostalgia for the sea?
The inner waves break on the outer slopes
Pressed into serving as the absent shore;
The scattered copses harden into rocks
On which the cornfields lap and throw up heads
Of fertile spray. And in the green half-light
Curious fishes nibble unlikely poppies.
But hillsides long grown used to cultivation,
Humble yet not obsequious, give way
With such a winning grace to absent tides
Which thus beset the mind, that the insistent
Promptings of memory are in their turn
Shamed into silence. As the waves recede,
The rocks, unharmed by an unlikely drowning
Shake into greener leaf among the corn.
And all the while the firm, elusive hills
Dipping and rounding in this landlocked bay
Ripple with harmless guile beneath the wind;
The point once made is lightly thrown away.

Ploughing
Watching them sink over the rim,
Their slow music still glimmers
In the furrows, carries high
Through the air the sure gait,
The poised instruction. Shining
On the flank and blade the sun resolves
The earned respite and the further turn
To crystal; the line dips
But is not lost. Thus
These earnest harmonies expand
Refracted wisdom, while
Stride surrenders to the throttled tempo
Of greater need. The tractor’s
Blue darkens with no sweat,
Wears its indifference over a yet
More complex lesson. The crystal
Slips from the sun, is glass.

An Owl in the Garden
Derisive his extravagance; he screams
His arching loops across the summer night
With unremembered shrillness, tunnels through
Suburban treetops, tangles with his themes.
Next morning, standing in the anxious light
Of commonplace, we see up where he drew
His grappling cries to snapping-point, the gleams
Of ductile wires, still dangerously tight.
Uneasily we say, I heard it too,
As if to find a centre from extremes,
And with its vagueness, to corrode the bright
Ensnarements of the old familiar view:
A wise and mournful bird. But these are dreams
We spun, not he, whose shriller wisdom might
If we allowed, hold more than these could do,
While some brown shadow beats over distant streams.

Street Plan
Some minds are perpetually flooded
By these grooved intersections, plotting
The city’s anonymous stance. A possible
Scene, curbed into latency,
Shouts urgently through the soles of the feet,
Delirium at the further corner
Of the next street. Walk then
Carefully, over the narrowing pavements,
Past the vertical bus-stops, the thirsting
Doorways. I have tightened my grasp
On some remoter purpose in many
Large cities, echoing with cries,
Swaying with huge, sightless tides,
All my pockets awash with broken glass.

Quite Certain
So it runs, gathering in twine
the turning; a rift
of pliancy so set, out from the root
through the drift and over
as the wind moves
necessity in incision against
the caged crystal
cross & recross
to sway: to split open
crushed and ground
on the fundament, of blue stone
hovering in shadow
this nails it, the epicentre
focused in necessity
outward, the mirrored spread
but in no dance, for such
forming displays more early lights
than the eye knows, unaided
by the caged motion, drypoint, in the mind

Nasturtiums
Sounds from the street slip
Inwards like paper; the morning
Draws its threads, bladed
With moisture, from the trees.
There is a wild greyness
Here in the room, knee-deep
In allusions of first light.
Some obscure privacy is
Offered like this, the raw
Wind in these noises: open
To neither dust nor fine sand
But shades of volcanic ash.

Without Fire
A fragrance tarnishes the air, is
Not festal, flickers with wider
Corrosion. It silts the mind in
Great drifts, ornate with poised
And always golden refusals; the burning
Hovers in vacancy. A mythic gesture,
Like these jewelled flames and their
Evasive accuracy, throws its rusting
Shadows down every single street.
One man, burning his rubbish
In the back garden, and each world
Shrinks into its shell. Those bitter
Frames are not houses, but
Shelters for such determined solitudes.

The Recoil
After that, the days were filled
With deep speckled grit and the shadows
Of how his movements happened; only
The beginning had thus been lost.
So, always watching his shadow
Over the grit and smooth stones,
He allowed his motions, saw them
Dance finally, on the spent ground.
As it passed other shadows, all
Held by their own fluid rims;
Joining and parting, the open grasp
Of a curled hand, towards edges
Of passion weightless as the stones
Floating in air. At this point
The recoil found him, and he took
With a stagger, his full weight.
From this place, he said, rocking slightly,
A start is possible; as he looked
About him, the last tremors of this
Fixity clenched his stubbed and bony hands.

Horizon
Which cannot be shifted, away from
This time of surprise, nor released against
Another sky, to set in order
Its own just beginnings. Either
Thrusts down a second root
To a further start of surprise, held
In surest recognition. The sea
Invites a coast already known
But still denies the knowing; twice
Is too certain of what may
Never have struck once, exactly.
Desperate shift, thus to renew
The same, so that once only
Counts a beginning, against this
Endlessly final and disordered sky.

Until Later On
Lurching among pine
cones and the sharp sand
drunken perhaps, in
the breathless demeanour
personally I’d rather
read about it
in a book
afterwards
though by the cast
of the wind latched
to the weather, I
know there’s no choice
I cannot wait
to be the angel
of my own
persuasion


KITCHEN POEMS
(1968)

The Numbers

<s

The whole thing it is, the difficult
matter: to shrink the confines
down. To signals, so that I come
back to this, we are
small / in the rain,
open or without it,
the light in delight, as with pleasure amongst not merely
the word, one amongst them; but the
skin over the points, of the bone.
That's where we have it & should
diminish: I am no
more, than custom,
which is the vital
& signal, again, as if we tie into
so many voices. Wish for them:
elect the principal, we must take
aim. That now is the life, which
is diffused, out of
how w e are too
surrounded, unhopeful.
The politics, therefore, is for one man.
a question of skin, that he ask
of his national point no more, in
this instance, than brevity. The
rest follows: so long regardful
of the rule, the decision
as knowledge and
above all, trust.
All too easy it seems with this slip
into trust if it weren't that silver
is another brightness, & we know it.
I must stand off from the warm
decay, invoke
some Danish insistence,
it doesn't concern any
of us, the risk
of exception
but we must each have, more

10

than, (IK - place defined by what
we owe (in the weak sense,
what wc too warmly
desire.
Only watch the weather
as the sky does change,
or the seasons in
quick-slip succession,
see it, as
walking is a white charge
in the bones we look at, constantly. Or
/'//constantly, without even a shred of desire
like maps at our feet. We want
too much for the others.
We must shrink / we
are small with it,
our pains are too earnest.
And the plain is wide: we are so
far. we should conserve
by election, which means at least
being less than so apt & so reasonable.
Able with reason, the light
isn't there, but down, in the
mines, for silver.
That's where the state is, where we should
recognise the renewed fact: William Smith
or suchlike could be the founder
if we needed that. Which I suspect myself
isn't so, as we have no
need of the star uppermost
in anyone's mind.
We are alive, the esteem already is
there in potential. It is
a firm question, of election,
the elect angels. Signs or array,
we should take this, we should
really do so. There is no other
beginning on power.
Such is to elect terms,
to be the ground for names.

11

We should come to the other thing, the
fluence of terminal systems, from there.
In the air, but first,
before that other thing
in the air.
One is each; and in
succession / or by elect
thus, there will be the
new wandering
star, in
the heavens, the
state of our own
coherence. These are the ligatures to
revise governance,
of the local disposing, the
quality as firstly position.
Here is the elect, the
folds of our intimate surface.
They call it peace
or history. Give it
nothing: to them
it is the elect,
the principal,
the voice.

Die A Millionaire
(pronounced "diamonds in the air")

The first essential is to take knowledge
back to the springs, because despite
everything and especially the recent
events carried under that flag, there is
specific power in the idea of it
that
what is known can be used to pick up
or more usually to hold on and develop
as what for the econometrist is
"profitable speculation "—the intellect
on the trigger once more, as those
poor seventh century Irish monks (being
sentimentalists) would have believed
if they could.
If there's any need
for proof & it can be kept from
running to violence (to which extremity it should anyway perhaps
be swooping homewards) the twist-point
is "purchase' —what the mind
bites on is yours
the prime joy of
control engineering is what they please
to denote (through the quartzite window) "selfoptimising systems", which they like
to consider as a plan for the basic
living unit. And thus "accelerating the convergence of function", we come to our
maximal stance.
Imperialism was just
an old, very old name for that
idea, that what you want, you by
historic process or just readiness
to travel, also "need"—and
need is <>l course the sacred daughter
ilinuigh whU h you improve, by

bet oiiilng more extensive < ompclitivc
expunMiiii II you i .in iles^n.ite ,i

prime direction, as Drang nach Osten
or the Western Frontier, that's to
purity the idea by recourse to History
before it happens. Envisaging the chapterhead in the historical outline as "the
spirit (need) of the age"—its primary
greed, shielded from ignominy by the
like practice of too many others.
That
of course is not expansion but acquisition
(as to purchase the Suez Canal was merely
a blatant example): the true expansion
is probably drift, as the Scythians
being nomadic anyway for the most part
slipped sideways right across the Russian
steppes, from China by molecular friction
through to the Polish border.
Otherwise it's
purchase, of a natural course, the alteration
or storage of current like dams in the
river: what starts as irrigation ends up
selling the megawattage across the grid.
The grid is another sign, is knowledge
in applique-work actually strangled & latticed
across the land; like the intangible consumer
networks, as the market defines wants from
single reckoning into a social need, graphed
for instance as 'contour tangent elimination".
And the drift of that is again to divert the
currency (as now in England
to the northcast). As, it was actually losing its grip
on the population. real people, slipping off
the face of that lovely ground, leaving the
green & pleasant lands of Northumberland
to be nearer the belly & catch scraps
with the shit we set out so grudgingly
on plates for the blind to eat in gratitude.
The grip is purchase again, and the current
chic of information theory will tell you how

14

many liiis of that commodity it takes to
lift one foot/lb. of shit to a starving mouth,
or not starving actually, but just rather
unthinkingly hungry.
And don't let some
wise and quick-faced historical rat tell us about
the industrial north and its misery, since evensongbird since then (& with no honourable
exception for D. H. Lawrence) has carolled about
that beautiful black colour as if
this were the great rot in the heart.
It was not and it is not. The twist-point
of this is again power by the grid, putting
lives into strings of consequence into
molecular chains like the pit-ponies we love
to cry over. Coal is so beautiful as I
could weep over the carbon it shines with:
what is scattered over those collier}' towns
is not soot or sulphur or coal or foaming
detergent but the waste produced by
mass-conversion of want (sectional) into
need (social & then total). All this by
purchase on the twist-point, the system gone
social to disguise
the greed of ambition
swimming in great seismic shocks through
the beds of our condition. All the needles are
twitching frantically across their smoky paper,
but society is " predictably"' as we know "in
a state of ferment'—as if that could ever turn
to wine or raise bread, from the sad shit it
is, to that crispy crunchy loaf we shall all
eat only in heaven.
The fact is that right
from the springs this water is no longer fit
for the stones it washes: the water of life
is all in bottles & ready for invoice. To draw
from that well we must put on some
other garment. Do what one can, that's
the gas-and-water talk, which is "do
what ive can" and we are the social strand
which is already past the twrist-point &

15

into the furnace. We don't hum only
because
we are invisible to each other,
our shoulders no longer so hopeless and
beautiful as they meet at the spine rising
up the dorsal rift: lovely and lonely, until
the whole spread squints into the neck and
vanishes, into the head.
And unlike Cerberus
we all share the same head, our shoulders
are denied by the nuptial joys of television,
so that what / am is a special case of
what we want. the twist-point missed exactly
at the nation's scrawny neck.
What runs
back, or could be traced upstream by simply
denying that conspiracy of "cause". is the
question of names & the seven tribes,
which are not "predictions" and socially can
be grouped only by the thinnest of
generalising systems. As these are not
economically self-centring, they cannot be
used as designations for targets (like
the gun-sight on what "we want").
And the back mutation is knoivledge and
has always been so in the richest tradition
of the trust it is possible to have, to repose
in the mysteries. The perversions which
thrust it forward. as a new feed into the
same vicious grid of expanding prospects
(profits) are let through by the weakness, now,
of names.
There is no other break in the
descent, since without that it's all break
anyway. The purity is a question of
names. We are here to utter them. This is
a prayer. I have it now between my
teeth and my eyes, on my forehead. Know
the names. It is as simple as the purity
of sentiment: it is as simple
as that.

16

Numbers in Time of Trouble
Whichever time standard we're on, the question
of how fast and whether it's worth it, we are
underlaid by drift in the form of mantle, and
that should at least be a start. If the woman
gets up in the morning you could say it
was to be anointed, if that (in this time)
weren't so puny and obsequious. The wrong
standard makes it so, and the brutal fact
is, that there's no simple difference of opinion
involved: the wrong is an entailment, and
follows into the glowing tail of "history" as
for example the Marxist comet burns with
such lovely, flaring destruction.
That we could come off the time standard is
a first (and preliminary) proposal; having
nothing to do with some zeal about traverse
or the synchronous double twist of a minor
protein. We could come off all that, together. into the nearest city of numbers
(of which there arc four, & could be five). 1'his
is just a proposal, set on the table to move
right out of range of those sickening and
greasy sureties—like "back to our proper
homes" (or look after the Golden Rose).
The homing instinct of a great deal
else might then be cracked up: the loving
magnetism by which consequence springs
to attentive display in the field of roses.
That, say, and the justice of what we
are said to deserve when so hopelessly
we want so much more. We do not
get what we deserve, ever, since we have
proper claim by the limits of hope and
however far a given desire has within range.
So, we could come off that standard, and
"possessive individualism" would be who we
are—the first city. Break the charter, lift
the harlot's curse, the revolted abstraction

17

of "populism" by which the dark is so feared.
I folding hands is a disgusting trick, and is
augmented by the expectation of plenty.
Which would set out our past as gained
into the territory of fortune, and dispose of
that lumpy yarn running back into the trees.
Again, what we recall is the choice, of our
prevalence, the rich garden of the climatic
terrain. And choice is not then one from
"the rest"—the elitist dream of the crown
donned in the Castle of Gold-but an
inclusion within that measure, of choice,
the second city of this middle earth.
And the question of "exchange" is thereby
also dismantled. The dispute, over how
far the values are trimmed, is strictly a
consequent disturbance, since "fair price"
is only the extent of our fears in the
chest, of whatever sundry moth & rust
we see in our age. "Our age"—at it
again, the credible is what we aptly wear
in our timid & tender years. The standard
is a fear index, a measure of what (for example) "natural gas" will do to a precarious economy. Whoever in some sheltered
domain called that vapour "natural" deserves
to laugh right into the desert. These are the
arid displacements beyond which lies in its state
the third city, or the jewel of the air.
Further than this, up to our necks in our
polluted history, the fourth city is not yet known.
Going off the standard is thus far only a
proposal: the mantle is warm and in
constant flow, but no man has yet crossed
the plains. No trumpets in any case for such
banal folly: the modest hatred of our condition and the competition which we therefore
call time. They will not sound, as we cannot
yet see the other side. But we deserve to, and
if we can see thus far, these are the few
outer lights of the city, burning on the horizon.

18

Sketch for a Financial Theory of the Self
1

The qualities as they continue are the silk
under the hand; because their celestial
progress, across the sky, is so hopeless & so
to be hoped for. I hope for silk, always, and
the strands are not pure though the name
is so. The name is the sidereal display, it
is what we know we cannot now have.
The last light is the name it carries,
it is this binds us to our unbroken trust.

2.

So then, we should not trust the hope
that is merely a name for silk, for
purity untouched by any Italian hand.
The celestial routine is begging, & a nasty
toy at that; the stars are names and the
names are necessarily false. We choose
to believe in the flotsam, the light glance
passing & innocent because unpriced.

3.

Which is grossly untrue, because we
pay for it well enough, I have squandered
so much life & good nature I could hardly
guess the account.
The numbers are out
there in the human
sky, the pure margin
which are the trust we
deserve.
And we should
have what the city does need,
the sky, if w e did not so
want the need.

4.

The name of that is of course money, and
the absurd trust in value is the pattern of
bond and contract and interest—just where
the names are exactly equivalent to the trust
given to them.
Here then is the purity of
pragmatic function:

19

we give the name of
our selves to our needs.
We want what we arc.
5.

And not silk, except for ties, or the skyas even for exchange, the coin of the
face we look up to as a vault ready
for trust. That much
is trickery,

but the names,
do you not
see, are just
the tricks we
trust, which
we choose.
The qualities then arc a name, corporately,
for the hope that they will return to us. The
virtue in whose exercise we retain the fiction
of air, silence, fluid round the hub of the week.
-'i

6.

How could this be clearer? The items are,
that we are bribed and that silk is a random but
by tradition a costly gift. Quality is habit.

7.

What follows is where we are now, or where
I am. The old cry about chastity, that we arc
bound by the parts of our unnatural frames.
The median condition is the city and not the travel
or the remoteness of travel, in sound. Music,
travel, habit and silence are all money; purity
is a glissade into the last, most beautiful return.

8.

And how much we hope for it is the primacy
of count. This is the shining grudge of numbers,
the name we will not lose to any possible stranger:
the star & silk of my eye, that will not return.

20

A Gold King Called Reluctance
As you drag your feet or simply being
tired, the ground is suddenly interesting;
not as metaphysic but the grave maybe,
that area which claims its place like
a shoe. This idea of the end is a neat
but mostly dull falsity, since the
biologic collapse is violence reversed,
like untying a knot.
And so slowness is
interesting and the dust, in cracks between
boards. The old ones have their senses
in the elegant droop they sometimes contrive, the knowing falter that makes it
all like some trick. Fluff, grit, various
discarded bits & pieces: these are the
genetic patrons of our so-called condition.
No resolve about places, the latch-key to
our drifting lives, seems relevant without
this smallest notion of dust. How to
purge the dismal objection to this, remains
a question. Not to be answered, but used,
as a metabolic regulator: pulse rate, place
rate, dust. If you lie on your back the
literalness of that position is a complete
transfer. Thus I
dream about courage
but love chiefly
several friends
and one woman
w h o is the Lady
of wherever we
may go.
The evident shift of pronoun (what I
now mean by " w e " ) is a clear question
about place. We eat to live. We afford
this; the genetic links arc everywhere claimed,
and you could say speech was the dominating discretion. All discretion is a private
matter, all changes of pace and childhood.

21

And as 1 emerge from feeling some lingering
sense of beginning, that privacy (having
all the time some start in view), this is another
and perhaps my greatest transfer. The publicis no more than a sign on the outside of the
shopping-bag; we are what it entails and
we remain its precondition. Even the most
modern shops, if you work at them, will
resolve into streets or thoroughfares; their
potential for transfer has simply been absorbed,
by trade.
The confinement of that is no option:
the public assertion of "value" does not over run the
channels, seeping into our discretion. Whom
we love is a tangled issue, much shared; but
at least we are neither of us worth it,
though we transfer
it into all other
matters; that
discretion is
our one place.
So that the dead are a necessity to us,
keeping our interest from being too much
about birth. The end is a carpet on
which we walk: they are our most formal
pursuit and we have our private matters
by this allowance.
I don't refuse the sign
in whom I know, because that's not a restriction. Who that is concerns
the question of w h o there is, i.e., being
in place to the hopes they are met by. The
English condition is now so abstract that
it sounds like an old record; the hiss and
crackle suborns the music, so that the
true literal has very few names. And we
too are remote within this, like the noble
gases, since it's our discretion that
is affected. Sedately torpid, we inquire
into our questions, the "burning issues"
that "face us on all sides".

22

The private
recourse that might also reclaim the transfer
is our hesitancy. Whenever we
find our unwillingness a form on which to pause.
The white pills have no mark on them &
the box extols three times daily, before meals.
But the meals are discretion. We can eat
slowly. We know all about the dead ones,
choosing to consider only the approach. Have
you had enough? Do have a little more?
It's very good but. no, perhaps I won't.
What dignity we avoid, as we
commit ourselves thankfully to these needs.
How definitely glad I am that greed is
an alternative to hunger. The few friends
are the genetic patrons, the Lady is
thankfully no
lady, I don't
owe anyone
that assurance.
And as the age or condition of this
fact we call place grows daily more remote,
the literalness thrives unchecked. The
imbalance is frightening; the splintered
naming of wares creates targets for want
like a glandular riot, and thus want
is the most urgent condition (e.g. not
enough credit).
I am interested instead in
discretion: what I love and also the spread
of indifferent qualities. Dust, objects of use
broken by wear, by simply slowing too much
to be retrieved as agents. Scrap; the old ones,
the dead who sit daily at the feast. Each
time I hesitate I think of them, loving what
I know. The ground on which we pass,
moving our feet, less excited by travel.

THE WHITE STONES
(1969)

Airport Poem: Ethics of Survival
The century roar is a desert carry ing
too much away; the plane skids off
with an easy hopeless departure.
The music, that it should
leave, is far down
in the mind
just as if the years were part of the
same sound, prolonged into the latent
action of the heart.
That is more: there
affection will shoot it up
like a crazed pilot. The desert
is a social and undedicated expanse, since
what else there is counts as merest propaganda.

*

The heart is a changed
petromorph, making
pressure a social
intelligence: essential news
or present fact
over the whole distance back
and further, away.
Or could be thus, as water
is the first social fluency
in any desert: the cistern
comes later and is an inducement of false power.
Which makes the thinning sorrow of flight
the last disjunction, of the heart: that
news is the person, and love
the shape of his compulsion
in the musical phrase,
nearly but not
yet back, into
the remotest
past.
Of which the heart is capable and will journey
over any desert and through the air, making
the turn and stop undreamed of:
love is, always, the
flight back
to where
w e are.

38

A Figure of Mercy, of Speech
On the hilt of fortune: so that he
asks the time and it's grey, with
almost solemn insistence. Yes it is, so
that perhaps only the smell of resin
holds him to a single
hopefulness. She knows
that, there is an oblique
incitement, between them.
The branches dissolve upwards, into slivers
of the horizon: for each, the fear of this, or too
far into the side. The rift that she loves
to play, as forward, the sound of his breathing kind.
In the light, that each
might, running from both
in reach to the distance
that is unspoken, in the eye
where love is, and the sound of water, euterpe
shall it be called. They will play over
the slip, making the flesh and nails on the
handsome fingers, to the action of the light,
will play the open palm
hoping to keep to it, the fearful
exaction of love: in grey light
and hope in columns, by the river side.

The Stranger, Instantly
The tie only: how I want so much
to allow for it, the wish to know
where, in that face
which is an absent
match, to the spirit.
So that a restless time
prevails; my spine arches
with the wish that's here
as itself a note a sign
of who they are.
And are, sitting in all the hours
of love I must translate, out
back to the place
where I feel it, as a local thing
and want now
to allow for:
to manage between the hands and hope
of the voice, that's it, there must be
a voice here also, lent
to but not taken—
since even from the edge the resting
waiting inshore is
travel as knowing, the quick
placement of love as
trust: at the source.
And so here, it is the others I most
take to, like stones
in the mist, in
the voice.

l iving In History
Walk by the shore, it is
a cool image, of water
a bearing into certain
distinctions, as
the stretch, out there
the temple of which way
he goes; and cannot shake
the haze, from
a list of small
flames.
He wants
only the patient ebb, as
following the shore: that's
not honest, but where
his foot prints and
marks his track
in the fact of
the evening
the path where he grabs at
motion, like a moist plant
or the worth, of
hearing the tide come in.
Walk on it, being a line, of rest
and distinction, a hope now lived up
to, a coast in awkward
singular desires
thigh-bone of the
world

On the Anvil
Finely, brush the
sound from your
eyes: it rests
in the hollow
as looking in
the shops at both
reflections, in
the glass
how
to move and the
sun slanting over
the streets: shielded
from the market
in the public
domain, as
taking the pace
of movement
in the hollow
furnished with that
tacit gleam, the
cavernous heart

42

The Holy City
Come up to it, as you stand there
that the wind is quite warm on the sides
of the face. That it is so, felt
as a matter of practice, or
not to agree. And the span,
to walk over the rough grass—all of this
is that we do, quite within acceptance
and not to press
the warm alarm
but a light
surface, a day
lifted from high
thick roots, upwards.
Where we go is a loved side of the temple,
a place for repose, a concrete path.
There's no mystic moment involved: just
that we are
is how, each
severally, we're
carried into
the wind which makes no decision and is
a tide, not taken. I saw it
and love is
when, how &
because we
do:you
could call it Ierusalem or feel it
as you walk, even quite jauntily, over the grass.

43

How It's Done
Always who turns is more than
the same, being in desire the pivot
of what he would most want: or
in point of fact, they say,
driving through the
early morning, to go to it.
And this is true, therefore, in such sense
as the light will allow. We take leave
of it, in the prospect of being allowed, on
as the rocks arc, the folds
let into the saddle, cut down
to any hope, acquired.
All the rage of the heart reaches this lifted
point, then: a fashion of spirit/a made thing
For this there is no name but trie event,
of its leaving. There is no
lattice, we don't sit by
the traffic lights bathing
the soul in the links of time. The place
rises, as a point of change. There are
rocks and trees as part of it, none in
forms of evidence. Within
limits this arena is
where each one is allowed
to be: the movement to be found, in the
distance is the sound that I too hope for,
here at the rock point, of the world.

44

If There is a Stationmastcr at
Stamford S.I). Hardly So
A matter of certain
essential oils
volatile
in the prolonged evening
nor would he allow
as the light stemmed
back
boarded up in the face of
that the line ran swiftly
and skimming the
crests only
into the hills of Vietnam
With so little water
the land creates a curved &
muted extension
the whole power is
just that, fantasy of control
the dispersion, in such
level sky
of each pulse the sliding
fade-through of hills
"a noble evasion of privacy"
This is parkland for
watered souls, the final
policeman's dream
that the quanta of wish
and desire, too, can be marched
off to some goal so distant
where in the hermitage
of our last days the
handcuffs would seem
an entirely proper
abstraction:
the dry and
arid gentleness, to the eye
with its own confidence
in the deep wells
of the spirit

45

All no more than
a land in drift
curled over and dry, hut
buried way under the ice
and as spillway for these
glacial waters the
scented air
runs easily into the
night and while
the public hope is as
always the
darkened ward
the icecap will
never melt
again why
should it

46

Iii the Long Run, to he Stranded
Finally it's trade that the deep changes
work with, so that the lives are heavier,
less to he moved from or blunted. The city
is the language of transfer
to the human account. Here
the phrases shift, the years
are an acquiescence.
This isn't a wild comment: there's no
good in the brittle effort, to snap the pace
into some more sudden glitter of light:
hold to this city or the slightly pale
walking, to a set rhythm of
the very slight hopefulness. That
is less than patience, it's time or more clearly
the sequence of years; a thickening in the words
as the coins themselves wear thin and could
almost balance on the quick
ideal edge. The stirring is so
slight, the talk so stunned, the
city warm in the air, it is a
too steady shift and life as
it's called is age and the merest impulse,
called the city and the deep
blunting damage of hope.
That's where it is, now
as the place to be left and the last
change still in return: down there
in the snow, too, the loyal city of man.

47

The Western Gate
Too far up, into the sky, so that
the hills slip with the wash of
the quick brightness. What could the weather
shift, by those changes of place?
Manganese on the brow;
the rich ore, clouds over
the stars, coming inshoreall the power of our sentiment, what we
do feel, wanting the inclusion, the shade.
Watch any road as it lies on the
seam of the earth, with that partly
turning & falling metaphvsic:
we believe it even despite
the engineers. The power
is the wish to move, to recognise a
concealed flame in the evening
or dawn or whatever. The gleam
is history, desire for a night sky
during the day too, since
the stars circle the hills &
our motives without reproach.
The formal circuit is inclusion. The line runs
inflected but the shapes are blue & shining.
It is the orbit, tides, the fluctual spread,
we shiver with reason and with love:
the hills are omens, & the
weather how long, with
the stars, we can wait.
Or, it rains and the camber of the road
slips into it too—it's all there, as
the brickwork or hope for advice.
Write a letter, walk across the wet pavement,
the lines are taut with
strain, maybe they'll
snap soon. The explosion
is for all of us and I dedicate the results
to the fish of the sea and the purity of
language: the truth is sadder but who
would ask me to hope only for that?

Break It
And again it finishes, as we should
say it's over, some completeness numbs me
with the final touch
we are sealed, thus
and why it should be so, well, that's life
not well, you see you see or we
do, we touch that, and
it's the last time or
thing or some edge. Like cliffs, the departure is overwhelming as a casual
thread, leading into this, that, the
gray darkness.
Call it evening the days
are no shorter but ah how they do
foreclose, that the tide turns and
the wick burns and curls and all
the acrid wavering of language, so full
of convenient turns of extinction. Phrase
falls, we call it an ancient city, as
we look down from
the heights, hugging
the only mountain for many miles.
Blessed, as we leave: that we do, how
we do what there is these are
the one thing:
where are you
I drift into what it
should be or have you do you have, would
you. Would you. Life is a gay bargain.
How could I say, where you are among
the mountains of the city in their midst.
Turn to the east, the west, the torque
at the waist running round
the ribs, and
settling there. The end of that is a
sorry thing, how much more
beautiful is the city than
the abrupt cliffs, the
end, of that?

Against Hurt
Endowed with so much
suffering, they should be / and that
they are so—the pain in the head
which applies to me
and the clouds low over
the horizon: soon it
will be dark
We love the brief night, for its
quick passing, the relative ease as
we slide into comfort and
the trees grow and
grow. I can hear
every smallest growth
the expanse is grinding with it,
out on the flats beyond, down by
the sodium street-lights, in the head:
pain, the hurt to these who are all
companions. Serenity
is their slender means.
There is not much time
left. I love them all, severally and in
the largest honour that there is.
N o w and with the least hurt, this
is for you.

52

Moon Poem
Tin- night is already quiet and I am
hound in the rise and fall: learning
to wish always for more. This is the
means, the extension to keep very steady
so that the culmination
will be silent too and flow
with no trace of devoutness.
Since I must hold to the gradual in
this, as no revolution but a slow change
like the image of snow. The challenge is
not a moral excitement, but the expanse,
the continuing patience
dilating into forms so
much more than compact.
I would probably not even choose to inhabit the
wish as delay: it really is dark and the knowledge
of the unseen is a warmth which spreads into
the level ceremony of diffusion. The quiet
suggests that the act taken
extends so much further, thereis this insurgence of form:
we are more pliant than the mercantile notion
of choice will determine—we go in this way
on and on and the unceasing image of hopeis our place in the world. We live there and now
at night I recognise the signs
of this, the calm is a
modesty about conduct in
the most ethical sense. We disperse into the ether
as waves, we slant down into a precluded notion
of choice which becomes the unlearned habit of
wish: where we live, as we more often are than
we know. If we expand
into this wide personal vacancy
we could become the extent
of all the wishes that are now too far beyond
us. A community of wish, as the steppe
on which the extension would sprinkle out
the ethic density, the compact modern home.
The consequence of this

53

pastoral desire is prolonged
as our condition, but
I know there is more than the mere wish to
wander at large, since the wish itself diffuses
beyond this and will never end: these are songs
in the night under no affliction, knowing that
the wish is gift to the
spirit, is where we may
dwell as we would
go over and over within the life of the heart
and the grace which is open to both east and west.
These are psalms for the harp and the shining
stone: the negligence and still passion of night.

54

Love in the Air
We are easily disloyal, again, and the light
touch is so quickly for us, it does permit
what each one would give in the royal
use of that term. Given, settled and
broken, under the day's sun: that's the purpose of the gleam from my eyes, cloud from
the base of the spine. Whose silent
watching was all spent, all foregonethe silver and wastage could have told you
and allowed the touch to pass. Over the
brow, over the lifting feature of how
slant in the night.
That's how we
arc disloyal, without constancy to the little
play and hurt in the soul. Being less than
strict in our gaze; the day flickers and
thins and contracts, oh yes and thus does
get smaller, and smaller: the northern
winter is an age for us and the owl of
my right hand is ready for flight. I have
already seen its beating search in the sky,
hateful, I will not look. By our lights
we stand to the sudden pleasure of how
the colour is skimmed to the world, and our
life does lie as a fallen and slanted thing.
If lie gives, the even tenor of his open
hands, this is display, the way and through
to a life of soft invasion. Is constancy
such a disloyal thing. With the hurt wish
torn by sentiment and how very gross our
threshold for pain has become. And the
green tufted sight that we pass, to and
from, trees or the grass and so much, still
permitted by how much we ask.
I ask
for all of it, being
ready to break
every constant thing.
We are bound and

55

we break, we let loose
what we nakedly hold
thus, he turns
she watches, the
hills slip, time
changes hands.
I ask for it all, and the press is the sea
running back up all the conduits, each
door fronting on to the street. What you can
afford is nothing-, the sediment on which we stand
was too much, and unasked for. Who is the
light linked to the forearm, in which play
and raised, up off the ground. I carry you forward, the motion is not constant but may
in this once have been so, loyalty is
regret spread into time, the hurt of how
steadily and where
it goes. She feels
the glimpse over
the skin. She is
honest: she loves
the steady
fear. The
durable fire.
And what you own, in this erotic furtherance,
is nothing to do with response or that
times do change: the matter is not to go
across, ever, making the royal deceit de nos jours.
As each one slips and descends, you could call
it coming down to the streets and the seedy
broken outskirts
of the town.

56

Bronze : Fish
Wc arc at the edge of all that and
can reach back to another
matter, only it's not back but
down rather, or in some involved
sense of further off. The virtues
of prudence, the rich arable soil:
but why should ever the whole
mercantile harvest run to form
again? The social cohesion
of towns is our newer ligature,
and the binding, you must see, is
the rule for connection, where we
are licensed to expect. That's
the human city, & we are
now at the edge of it. Which way
are we facing. Burn the great sphere:
count them, days of the week.

57

For a Quiet Day
There are some men that focus
on the true intentness, as I know
and wouldn't argue with: it is
violent, the harp-I will not do it
though, and the time is
so gentle, in the shadow
that any youth might
sleep. But I will
not do it, with the gilded harp
and of all things, its pedals, for
the nice touch. As the curves too
are sometimes gentle, where we shall bein the succession of
light, hope, the
evening
distracts: and it is always too
fine, too hopeless and will not let
the gentle course—by the chance
rise of a voice.
And if the intentness
is the more true, then
I want the gentler
course, where
the evening is more of what we are:
or the day as well-moist, casual,
broken by inflictions of touch. This
is the resting-place, out in the street.
That we are so, and
for the other thing
I will not do it, will
not; this is a quiet day.

58

Just So
How long they ask, we ask, it
is the question. So much time to
travel or stop and yet the heart
is so slow & reluctant
leave it, that's one
way—there, on the#
ground: I love you
so, here but how long again, the
history of what we allow, are permitted to have. A life for this
branch, dividing in the headlights
waiting, the beam in
prism, play or the sound
in a great arc for the
world, it is an open fire, a hearth
stone for the condition of trust.
Don't ever wait for that. Twist it
out, in ply and then run. for
the door: we must
have the divine sense,
of entrance. The way
in as what it is, not which then, or
how long as the question. Such thing
are, the world is that fire, it burns
along all the horizons. It is
the heart, where we
k are. I love you, so
P much. As this, as
this, which is for even more than I
could tell. The night flickers and
the day comes; has, will come. That's
the question, the mark strapped to
Wthe hands; not the
"eyes. Trust them, the
fire of the mind, lust
of the pure citizen, on every path
of the earth. The soil, tarmac, grass,

59

remorse, the sea, love in the air
we breathe. Fire on the hearth. The life
in what I now have
and listen to, just so
long, as we are.

60

Mouth Open
To set a name to it, hold them
down and ask merely
are they shouting, with both feet
planted and leaning towards me
the note forming no consequence, they gulp the
landscape before them
Alert, to the name of an occasion
which is theirs as I take
it from them, the offered gift
met by the purest sound
I cannot hold this
it is a name: shouting
or leaning, on the singleearth which is below them, each one

From End to End
Length is now quite another thing; that is.
waiting or coming right up slap into the sun,
spreading into the land to cross, the smell of
diesel oil on the road. The friends there are,
as if residing in what instantly goes with it,
as if longer than the infinite desire, longer
and across into some other thing. Keeping
the line, running back up into the mountains,
denied. And so, in the actual moment dishonest, actually refusing the breakage, and
your instinct for the whole purpose
again shows
how gently it is all broken
and how lightly, as you
would say, to come in.
All the milky quartz of that sky. pink and
retained, into the sun. See such a tiling climb
out of the haze, making the bridge straight
down into the face-which way, this way,
length beyond this, crossed. The dawn thing
suddenly isn't tenuous, and the reach back to
the strand is now some odd kind of debris:
how strange to
say this, which abandons of
course all the joy of not
quite going, so far.
I would not have recognised it if the sun
hadn't unexpectedly snapped the usual ride,
and with you a real ironist, your length
run off out into some other place. Not the
mountains, nothing to do with the sacred child.
The continued quality I know is turned down,
pointed into the earth: love is a tremor, in
this respect, this for the world without length.
Desire is the turn to a virtue, of extent
without length. How
I feel is still along this path,
down the cancelled line and
even in the dawn
as almost a last evening, coming back the

62

day before. Where they all live, and to say
such a thing is as you say it, promptly no
clouds but the sun. How else, in the face
of so much prudence, as the total staff of life;
as the friends, glittering (who would ever have
been ready for that? The sun, the red
shift; your hair
is at the moment copper, a
bronze mark, and the absurd
gift is just some
allowance, a generous move. How would that
ever have been so. the length taken down and
my nervous rental displayed. Not just holding
or drawing the part. You are too ready, since I
know you still want what we've now lost, into
the sun. Without either, the mark of our light
and the shade as you walk without touching
the ground. Lost it. by our joint throw,
and the pleasure, the breakage is no longer, no
more length in which we quickly say
good-bye, each to each at the meridian. As now
each to each good-bye I love you so.

63

The Wound, Day and Night
Age by default: in some way this must
be solved. The covenants that bind
into the rock, each to the other
are for this, for the argon dating
by song as echo of the world.
O it runs sweetly by, and prints over
the heart; I am supremely happy,
the whole order set in this, the
proper guise, of a song. You can hear
the strains from so far off: withdrawn
from every haunted place
in its graveness, the responsive
shift into the millions of years.
I am born back there, the plaintive chanting
under the Atlantic and the unison of forms.
It may all flow again if we suppress the
breaks, as I long to do,
at the far end of that distance
and tidings of the land;
if we dissolve the bars to it and let run
the hopes, that preserve the holy fruit on the tree,
casting the moist honey, curing the poppy of sleep.
'And in variety of aspects
the sum remains the same,
one family"—
that it be too much with us, again as
beyond that enfeebled history: that we be
born at long last into the image
of love

64

Hu Glacial Question, Unsolved
In the matter of ice, the invasions
were partial, so that the frost
was a beautiful head
the sky cloudy
and the day packed into the crystal
as the thrust slowed and we come to
a stand, along the coast of Norfolk.
That is a relative point, and since
the relation was part to part, the
gliding was cursive; a retreat, followed
by advance, right to north London. The
moraine runs axial to the Finchley Road
including hippopotamus, which isn't a
joke any more than the present fringe
of intellectual habit. They did live as
the evidence is ready, for the successive
drift.
Hunstanton to Wells is the clear
margin, from which hills rise into
the "interior "; the stages broken through
by the lobe bent south-west into the Wash
and that sudden warmth which took
birch trees up into Scotland. As
the 50° isotherm retreats there is
that secular weather laid down in pollen
and the separable advances on Cromer (easterly)
and on Gipping (mostly to the south).
The striations are part of the heart's
desire, the parkland of what is coast
inwards from which, rather than the reverse.
And as the caps melted, the eustatic rise
in the sea-level curls round the clay, the
basal rise, what we hope to call "land".
And the curving spine of the cretaceous
ridge, masked as it is by the drift, is
wedged up to the thrust: the ice fronting
the earlier marine, so that the sentiment
of "cliffs" is the weathered stump of a feeling
into the worst climate of all.

65

Or if that's
too violent, then it's the closest balance that
holds the tilt: land/sea to icecap from
parkland, not more than 2°-3° F. The
oscillation must have been so delicate, almost
each contour on the rock spine is a weather
limit
the ice smoothing the humps off,
filling the hollows with sandy clay
as the litter of 'surface". As the roads
run dripping across this, the rhythm
is the declension of history, the facts
in succession, they are succession, and
the limits are not time but ridges
and thermal delays, plus or minus whatever
carbon dates we have.
We arc rocked
in this hollow, in the ladle by which
the sky, less cloudy now, rests on our
foreheads. Our climate is maritime, and
"it is questionable whether there has yet been
sufficient change in the marine faunas
to justify' a claim that
the Pleistocene Epoch itself
has come to an end." We live in that
question, it is a condition of fact: as we
move it adjusts the horizon: belts of forest,
the Chilterns, up into the Wolds of Yorkshire.
The falling movement, the light cloud
blowing in from the ice of Norfolk
thrust. As the dew recedes from the grass
towards noon the line of recession
slips back. We know where the north
is, the ice is an evening whiteness.
We know this, we are what it leaves:
the Pleistocene is our current sense, and
what in sentiment we are, we
are, the coast, a line or sequence, the
cut back down, to the shore.

Charm Against Too Many Apples
Still there is much to be done, on the
way into the city, and the sky as yet
only partly written over; we take all
our time and the road is lined with apple trees.
That's where we go, then, and if this sounds
too obviously prolonged, remember that
the ice was our prime matter. Flame is only
just invisible in sunlight
and the smoke goes
wavering into the atmosphere with all the
uncertainty of numbers. And so wc can't
continue with things like this, wc can't simply
go on. In this way through the forest, we
lose too much and too quickly: we have
too much to lose. How can anyone hope,
to accomplish what he wants so much not
finally to part with. We even pick up
the fallen fruit on the road
frightened by the
layout of so much fallen, the chances we know
strewn on the warm gravel. Knowing that
warmth is not a permanence, ah we count
on what is still to be done and the keen
little joys of leaves & fruit still hanging up
on their trees.
Whereas I wish that it would
all drop, or hang in some other way suspended;
that we should not be so bribed, by incompletion. The ransom is never worth it and
we never get it anyway. No one can eat so
many apples, or remember so much ice. I
wish instead that the whole federate agency
would turn out into and across the land.
With any circling motion it could be so easily
for them, theirs as a form of knowledge, and we
would rest in it: the knowledge that nothing
remains to be done. What we bring oft is
ours by a slip of excitement: the sky is our eternal
city and the whole beautiful & luminous trance
of it is the smoke spreading
across into the upper air.

First Notes oil Daylight
Patience is truly my device, as wc wait
for the past to happen, which is to come into
the open. As I expect it to, daily & the question is really what size we're in, how much of
it is the measure, at one time. Patience is
the sum of my inertia, by which the base-line
lays itself out to the touch
like the flower in
heaven, each pebble
graded in ochre. How
to extend, anyway to decline the rhetoric
of occasion, by which the sequence back
from some end is clearly predictive. We
owe that in theory to the history of person
as an entire condition of landscape—that
kind of extension, for a start. The open
fields we cross, we carry ourselves by ritual
observance, even sleeping in the library.
The laggard, that is,
whose patience
is the protective
shield, of the true
limit to size.
'"The ceremonial use of the things described",
the cinar trees or the white-metal mirror, forms
of patience, oh yes, and each time I even
move, the strophic muscular pattern is use, in
no other sense. The common world, how far we
go, the practical limits of daylight. And as I
even think of the base-line the vibration is
strong, the whole sequence of person as his
own history is no more than ceremonial,
the concentration
of intersect: discovery back to
the way over, the
entire crossing an open fabric, which we wear
stand on or carry in the hand. That this could
really be so & of use is my present politics,
burning like smoke, before the setting of fire.

Frost and Snow, Falling
That is, a quality of man and his becoming,
beautiful, or the decoration of some light and
fixed decision, no less fluent than the river
which guards its name. The preservative
of advice, keeping to some kind of order,
within the divine family of ends. The snow
level is where it fell and the limit thus
of a long cadence, the steppe whitening
in the distance and the winter climate.
The fall of snow, as of man in the ice block
and its great cracking roar, is a courtesy;
we don't require the black spiral, being gentle
and of our own kind. We run deeper, cancel
the flood, take to the road or what was before
known as champaign. We stand off the shore
even when turning to our best and most serious
portions of time. I judge that, as a snow level
but equally in seasonal pasture, pleasure or
as the rival comes, with clay on his shoes.
How far have you come and how long was your
journey? Such persons are hungry; the rival
ventures his life in deep water, the reddish gold
glints in the shadows of our lustful solitude.
So that when the snow falls again the earth
becomes lighter and lighter. The surface conspires with us, we are its first-born. Even
in this modern age we leave tracks, as we
go. And as we go, walk, stride or climb
out of it, we leave that behind, our own
level contemplation of the world. The monk
Dicuil records that at the summer solstice
in Iceland a man could see right through the
night, as of course he could. That too is a
quality, some generous lightness which we
give to the rival when he comes in. The tracks
are beaten off, all the other things underground.
On 9th May 1247 they set out on the return
journey. "We travelled throughout the winter, often

70

sleeping in the desert on the snow except when
we were able to clear a place with our feet.
When there were no trees but only open country
we found ourselves many a time completely
covered with snow driven by the wind." That
sounds to me a rare privilege, watching
the descent down over the rim. Each man
has his own corner, that question which
he turns. It's his nature, the quality he
extends into the world, just as his stature is
his "royal dignity". And yet Gregory did not
believe in the pilgrimage of place: Jerusalem,
he says, is too full of rapine and lust to be
a direction of the spirit. The rest is some kind
of flame, the pilgrim is again quality, and
his extension is the way he goes across the crust
that will bear him. The wanderer with his
thick staff: who cares whether he's an illiterate
scrounger-he is our only rival. Without this
the divine family is a simple mockery, the
whole pleistocene exchange will come to
melt like the snow, driven into the ground.

71

For This, For This
The next stave we come to is the mansion
or house, wondering about the roof and the
set, as it were, back into the silence which
is the social division, split into quietness.
Why are we so tensed as we prepare to make
some side step, into the house and thus, you
would say, out of the world. Off the planet
even, while the amber glow of Mercury shines
from the flashing shield? Oh no it's not this,
any more than we deny the sound its direction,
choosing to "hear" the splinter and splash
of some ordinary thing.
I will not listen, or claim
to, that ignoble worship of
the wrong road. They are
too clean, always, they
fall in part to part, this knife
will go straight into
the fire if that's the heart.
And perto when pou seest pat allc soche werkes in peire

for pat is pe most ese for pee for to doo if pou wilt

Watch the colour run up the blade, watch the
house held off, we live so much in this way.
How does he know when to "speak his mind"
and come back in through some pattern of
misery? Buying his way in through this price
making the doorway, and now even current coin
is frozen in the banks; some weird puritan
stringency that believes cold to be bracing.
All the quick motions
as we nip upstairs, turn
to steps we take: leading
to the moral exits

72

which wc see enjoined. Some idea of
completeness; protection
is wretched and what wc pay for.
Anil leue pe corious beholdyng & seching in pi wittes to

Yet some soft stirring to speak is in the air,
the casual motion flirts with us. We are
less sombre now, slipping out at the door
and into some silent affair through which
we hear everything. All of that, without
name, not with regret, as a musical turn.
The importance is complete, the sequence
is urban, needful; she comes like some
obvious choice, picking her way. I see
this, you see the world in her wide sails,
the knife is not playful
or an agent of just
device. It conies from
the kitchen, I'm not
going to tell you that; you know
how outside the door too
we are ready in one.

In Cimmerian Darkness
When the faint star does take
us into the deeper parts
of the night there is
that sudden dip
and we swing across into
some other version of this
present age, where any curving
trust is set into
the nature of man, the green raw and fabulous
love of it, where every star that shines,
as he said, exists
in love, the brother
dipping into the equal limit,
help as the ready art, condition of the
normal
since no more simple
presence will fade, as the dawn does, over
water, the colonies of feeling like stacks
of banknotes waiting to be counted.
Anyone waits, the brother is a section of
the waiting art, whereby and
through which agency the whole
cosmic vibrations disport their limbs, their
hopes, the distant repose.
We dip into the ready world
which waits for us: the
name of it is our brother and we must protect what we want of it,
as we need more than I personally
can ever admit. Or now do so
admit, the title to this going into the sky
is the trust of the lighted brother in the
first sense, the standard.
Stand there, 1 implore you, the trust is an agency
of surrender, I give it all up. the star
is yielded. No part of this dipping
coil shall be withheld; no
light further than the figure of some complete
fortune, making and made weak
by affection and the promise of it.

74

l td K> iIK- star, trusting to rotten planks,

in sequence, in this parity of
art ready with its own motion. It swings out
and we are quickly cruel, the brother reforms
his wish to roam the streets, lie
should refuse as much as he can.
Nor is the divine in any sense
full, the vacancy stretches away
to the standard out on the plain; the cups
of our radio telescopes stand openly
braced to catch the recoil. Focus, the
hearth is again warm, again the human patch
waits, glows in the slight wind.
And we are ready for this, the array is there in
the figure we name brother, the
fortune we wish for, devoutly, as the dip
turns us to the face we have
so long ignored; so fervently refused.

Song in Sight of the World
In sight of the world they arc
heavy with this, the sea
thrown up, the shore and all
the lamps out on the road—
but where are they, will
they go to: why do
not love and instruction
come swiftly to the places
where they stand? Who arc the muses
in this windblown instalment—as
if there is much uncertainty
about that. We arc a land
hammered by restraint, into
a too cycladic past. It is
the battle of Maldon binds
our feet: we tread
only with that weight & the empire
of love, in the mist. The name of this
land, unknown, is that. Heavy with sweat
wc long for the green hills, pleasant with
waters running to the sea
but no greater love. The politics
of this will bear inspection. They are
the loss of our each motion, to history.
Which is where the several lost stand
at their various distance from the shore
on gneiss or the bones of a chemical plan
for the world's end. This is it, Thule,
the glyptic note that we carry
with every unacted desire felt
in the continent of Europe. Lot's
wife, the foreshore of the world.
And the weight? Still with us, the hold
is a knowing one. The night is beautiful
with stars: we do not consider the end
which is a myth so powerful, as to throw
flames down every railway line
from London to the furthest tip
cape and foreland left by the axe.
Apollo it is that I love, that

shall be swallowed by the ureal wolf and be
reborn as a butterfly in the hair of a goddess.
We are poor in this, but I love
and will persist in it, the equity
of longing. The same is not true
but desired: I desire it and shall
encircle the need with bands of iron,
this is the wedge of my great hope.
All the shores are a single peak. All the
sea a great road, the shore a land in
the mist. The tears of the world are spread
over it. and into the night you can hear
how the trees burn with foreknowledge.
As before, I am the great lover
and do honour to Don Juan, & sharpen
his knife on the flat of my foot.
The forest, of stars. The roads, some grey
people walking towards the restaurant.
1'he headlights, as a lantern; now they are
in the restaurant. See, we shall eat them.
The light will do all this, to
love is the last resort, you
must know, I will tell
you, this, love, is
the world.

Quality in that Case as Pressure
Presence in this condition is quality
which can be transformed & is subject
even to paroxysm—but it is not
lapse: that is the chief point. As 1
move with my weight there is collusion,
with the sight of how we would rise
or fall or on the level. How much we
see is how far we desire change, which
is transformation from the ridge and foreland inverted—with all the clouds
over the shore.
The sun lies on the
matching of the ridge. &
passing is what you
cannot have, it is
the force, where

pleasure as a name for each part:

mild weather is violent; I am moved
by the condition of knowledge, as the
dispersion of form. Even, tenuous, gorged

They are the children of proof.
The proof is a feature, how the

is at least temporarily displaced.
By seepage or transgression, the mineral salts
"found their way" into the Zechstein Sea. The
reciprocation of fault and inversion,
poverty the condition, of which I am so clearly
guilty I can touch the pleasure involved.
For such guilt is the agency of ethical fact:
we feel shame at the mild weather too and
when the National Plan settles comfortably
like a Grail in some sculpted precinct
I am transported
with angelic
nonchalance.

of want—of lack or even (as wc are told)

this is the chosen remnant, of a plan
now turned on its axis, east-west into the

honour, and
in this the peace of the city does now reside.

In the year; intact in the cycle of days
passing over him like the damp air
he is back on the first level,
some floating completeness
has assailed him. He
is perfect. In the sight of his eye the

has come so far, round over the crests
and fields, the cornea moist the
lymph draining and curled
down to rest. This level sequence of history
is his total and our total
also, is
the certain angular sustenance
of the world. So I walk over the
top of the steady and beating level of his
eye; he has so much to bestow, he is
generous. What he has is our
shout, the sound of the pathway, going down into
the breathing touch of the air. the rain
which soaks into our clothes. At last

Shadow Songs
1
The glorious dead, walking
barefoot on the earth.
Treat them with all you
have: on the black marble
and let Nightingale come
down from the hills.
Only the procession is halted
as this spills down into
the current of the river:
their glorious death, if
such on earth were found.

2
And if the dead know this,
coming down into the dark, why should
they be stopped? We are too gentle
for the blind to see or be heard.
All the force of the spirit lies open
in the day, praise in the clock face
or age: the years, with their most
lovely harm. Leading the gentle
out into the wilds, you know they
are children, the blind ones, and
the dead know this, too.

Concerning Quality, Again
So that I could mark it; the continuance of
quality could in some way be that, the time
of accord. For us, as beneath the falling water
we draw breath,
look at the sky.
Talking to the man hitching a lift back
from the hospital, I was incautious in sympathy:
will she be back soon I was wishing to
encourage his will to suppose. I can hardly
expect her back he said and the water
fell again, there was this sheet, as the time
lag yawned, and quality
became the name you have,
like some anthem to the absent forces of nature.
Ethnic loyalty, breathe as you like we in fact
draw it out differently, our breath is gas
in the mind. That awful image of choking.
We have no mark for our dependence, I would
not want to add a little red spot to the wrist of
the man in the newsreel, the car passing the lights.
I draw blood whenever I open my stupid mouth,
and the mark is on my hand, I
can hardly even feel the brass wire
nailed down into the head.
Paranoid, like the influencing machines; but who
they are, while their needs shine out like flares,
that quality is their presence outward to the night
sky: they do ask for that casual aid. The recognition is accident, is an intolerable fall like
water. We whizz on towards the blatant home
and the armies of open practice. His affairs are
electric; they cancel the quality of the air;
the names are a blankness as
there are no marks but the wounds.
Even the accord, the current back (for him as for
me outward) has an electric tangent. He could
have flown off just there as he was. Simply
moved sideways, in his sitting posture, across the

82

next hedge and into a Held I know hut could
not recognise. The mark is Abel's price, the
breath is blood in the ears as I even dare to think
of those instruments. The sky is out there with
the quality of its pathic glow, there is a bright
thread of colour across the dashboard; the accord
is that cheap and we live
with sounds in the ear
which we shall never know.

83

On the Matter of Thermal Packing
In the days of time now what I have
is the meltwater constantly round my feet
and ankles. There the ice is glory to the
past and the eloquence, the gentility of
the world's being; I have known this
as a competence for so long that the
start is buried in light
usual as the warm grass and shrubbery
which should have been ancestral
or still but was, then, bound like crystal
into the last war. There was a low
drywall, formal steps
down I now see to the frozen water, with
whitened streaks and bands in it;
the same which, in New England, caused
a total passion for skating, and how still
it all was
the gentility of a shell, so
fragile, so beautifully
shallow in the past; I
hardly remember
the case hardened
but brittle
constant to the eighteenth century or the
strictly English localism of moral candour,
disposed in the copses of those fields
which bespoke easily that same vague lightness,
that any motion could be so much

The Common Gain, Reverted
The street is a void in the sequence of man,
as he sleeps by its side, in rows that house
his dreams. Where he lives, which is the
light from windows, all the Victorian grandeur
of steam from a kitchen range. The street
is a void, its surface slips, shines and is
marked with nameless thoughts. If we could
level down into the street! Run across by
the morning traffic, spread like shadows, the
commingling of thoughts with the defeat we
cannot love
Those who walk heavily
carry their needs, or lack
of them, by keeping their
eyes directed at the ground
before their feet. They arcsaid to trudge when in fact their empty thoughts
unroll like a crimson carpet before their
gentle & delicate pace. In any street the pattern
of inheritance is laid down, the truth is for our
time in cats-eves, white markings, gravel
left from the last fall of snow. We proceed
down it in dreams, from house to house which
spill nothing on to the track, only light on the
edge of the garden. The way is of course speech
and a tectonic emplacement, as gradient it
moves easily, like a void
It is now at this
time the one presence
of fact, our maze
through which we
tread the shadow or
at mid-dav pace
level beneath our own. And in whichever form
we are possessed the surface is sleep again and
we should be thankful. By whatever movement,
I share the anonymous gift, the connivance
in where to go as what I now find myself
to have in the hand. The nomad is perfect
but the pure motion which has no track is

88

utterly lost; even the Esquimaux look for sled
markings, though on meeting they may not speak.
The street that is the
sequence of man
is the light of his
most familiar need,
to love without being stopped for some immediate bargain, to be warm and tired
without some impossible flame in the heart.
As I walked up the hill this evening and felt
the rise bend up gently against me I knew
that the void was gripped with concentration.
Not mine indeed but the sequence of fact,
the lives spread out, it is a very wild and
distant resort that keeps a man. wandering
at night, more or less in his place.

Aristeas, in Seven Years
Gathering the heat to himself, in one thermic
hazard, he took himself out: to catch up with
the tree, the river, the forms of alien vantage

and hence the first way
by theft into the upper world—"a
natural development from the mixed
economy in the drier or bleaker
regions, where more movement was
necessary "—and thus the

And his songs were invocations in no frenzy'

pure base of his mind; he heard the small
currents in the air & they were truly his aid.
In breath he could speak out into the northern
air and the phrasing curved from his mouth
and nose, into the cold mountain levels. It
was the professed Apollo, free of the festive line,

it was: like that: as itself
the skeleton of the possible

stones or a barrow.
Leaving the flesh vacant then, in a fuller's shop.
Aristeas removed himself for seven years
into the steppes, preparing his skeleton and the
song of his departure, his flesh anyway touched
by the invading Cimmerian
twilight: "ruinous"
as the old woman's
prophecy.
And who he was took the

Each where as
the extent of day determines, where the
sky holds (the brightness
dependent on that).
And Apollo is in any case seasonal, the
divine "used only of a particular god,
never as a general term." The Hyperborean paradise was likewise no general
term but the mythic duration of
spirit into the bone
laid out in patterns
on the ground
"the skulls are sent on hunting
journeys, the foot-prints alongside;
that towards which they journey
they turn them towards, so that
they will follow behind."
From the fuller's shop as from
the camp of the seal hunter,

some part of the bone must be twisted
& must twist, as the stages of Cimmerian
wandering, viz:
1. 1800-13th Century B.C., north
of the Caucasus, then
2. 13th-8th Centuries, invaded
by the Scythians and deflected
southwards & to the west. And
3. after that, once more displaced
(8th Century to maybe 500 B.C.),
the invasion of Asia Minor,
"ruinous", as any settled and complaisant fixture
on the shoreline would regard the movement of
pressure irreducible by trade or bribery. Hence
the need to catch up, as a response to cheap money
and how all that huddle could
be drawn out
into the tenuous upper
reach, the fine chatter
of small birds under the
head of the sky
(sub divo columine)
on the western slope of the Urals and the scatter

93

of lightning, now out of doors & into
the eagle span,

the ti ne condition of bone
which is no more singular or settled or the
entitled guardian even, but the land of the
dead. Why are they lost, why do they
always wander, as if seeking
their end and drawing after them
the trail and fume of burning hemp?
Or they are not lost but
passing: if thoughtless abandonment
to the moment were really a blessing, I
had actually been in the Land of the
Blessed."
But it was not blessing, rather a fact so
hard-won that only the twist in middle
air would do it anyway, so even he be wise
or with any recourse to the darkness of
his tent. The sequence of issue is no
more than this,
Apollo's price, staff
leaning into the
ground and out
through the smoke-hole.
It is the spirit which dies
as the figure of change, which
is the myth and fact of extent,
which thus does start from
Marmora, or Aklavik, right
out of the air.
No one harms these people: they
are sacred and have no
weapons. They sit or pass, in
the form of divine song,
they are free in the apt form of
displacement. They change
their shape, being of the essence as
a figure of extent. Which
for the power in rhyme

is gold, in this northern clime
which the Greeks so held to themselves and
which in the steppe was no more
than the royal figment.

94

This movement was of
course cruel beyond belief, as this
was the risk Aristcas took
with him. The conquests were for the motive of
sway, involving massive slaughter as the
obverse politics of claim. That is, slaves and
animals, life and not value: 'the western Sarmatian tribes lived side by side not in a loose
tribal configuration, but had been welded
into an organised imperium
under the leadership of one
royal tribe." Royalty
as plural. Hence the calendar as taking of
life, which left gold as the side-issue, pure
figure.
Guarded by the griffins, which lived close to the
mines, the gold reposed as the divine brilliance,
petrology of the sea air, so far from the shore.
The beasts dug the metal out with
their eagle beaks, rending in the
cruel frost of that earth, and
yet they were the guardians, the figure of flight
and heat and the northern twist of the axis.
His name Aristeas, absent for
these seven years: we should
pay them or steal, it is no
more than the question they ask.

Seftor Vazquez Speaking and Further
Soft Music to Eat By
So today it is quite hot again and the
erotic throb of mere air replaces the traffic;
we (the warmed-up) are not separate
from the body flowing into and just being
with air. So delectable, another sense for
presence, glandular pressure; so all
the dark air comes running
up like some woven thing,
soft like our own possessions.
We read about that in cheap paperbacks—maybe
today it's the turn of the scarlet athlete.
Anyway, the angelic hosts were undisturbed
in their eminence of domain, not caring
at all for charter or land reform. In that
sense mostly far distant from the Colombian
peasants whose current leader is so
evidently named by a small promethean gesture.
To return, this is an
intimately physical place,
picked out of the air like
forbidden fruit. So much air and so close I
can feel the lunar caustic I once used in
a lab note-book headed "analysis". Now
it's Laforgue again, the evening a deep city
of velvet and the Parisian nitrates washed off
into the gutters with the storm-water. In the
more entire flarings of sheet lightning the
rain-drops glittered violently in their
descent, like a dream of snake's eyes.
All this the static and
final saturation of air:
the physical world in
which, somewhere out in the Andes or in
the jungle valleys the same bitter spasm
is fought, for life and traffic: it is the

97

air, wc breathe and if
now it
trembles like some satiric
sexual excitement we
are no more than the air we
now are, baffled. The angels have
no reason to worn-, about that.

98

Thoughts on the Estcrhazy Court Uniform
I walk on up the hill, in the warm
snn and we do not return, the place is
entirely musical. No person can live there
& what is similar is the deeper resource, the
now hidden purpose. I refer directly to my
own need, since to advance in the now fresh &
sprouting world must take on some musical
sense. Literally, the grace & hesitation of
modal descent, the rhyme unbearable, the
coming down through the prepared delay and
once again we are there, beholding the
complete elation of our end.
Each move
into the home world is that same loss; we
do mimic the return and the pulse very
slightly quickens, as our motives flare in
the warm hearth. What I have is then already
lost, is so much there I can only come down
to it again, my life slips into music &
increasingly I cannot take much more of this.
The end cadence deferred like breathing, the
birthplace of the poet: all put out their lights
and take their instruments away with them.
How can we sustain such constant loss.
I ask myself this, knowing that the world
is my pretext for this return through it, and
that we go more slowly as we come back
more often to the feeling that rejoins the whole.
Soon one would live in a sovereign point and
still we don't return, not really, we look back
and our motives have more courage in
structure than in what we take them to be.
The sun makes it easier & worse, like the
music late in the evening, but should it start
to rain—the world converges on the idea
of return. To our unspeakable loss; we make
sacred what we cannot see without coming
back to where we were.

99

Again is the sacred
word, the profane sequence suddenly graced, by
coming back. More & more as we go deeper
I realise this aspect of hope, in the sense of
the future cashed in, the letter returned to sender.
How can I straighten the sure fact that
we do not do it, as we regret, trust, look
forward to, etc? Since each time what
we have is increasingly the recall, not
the subject to which we come. Our chief
loss is ourselves; that's where I am, the
sacral link in a profane world, we each do
this by the pantheon of hallowed times.
Our music the past tense:
if it would only
level out into some complete migration of
sound. I could then leave unnoticed, bring nothing
with me, allow the world free of its displacement. Then I myself would be the
complete stranger, not watching jealously
over names. And yet home is easily our
idea of it, the music of decent and proper
order, it's this we must leave in some quite
specific place if we are not to earn it
everywhere with us.
I know I will go back
down & that it will not be the same though
1 shall be sure it is so. And I shall be even
deeper by rhyme and cadence, more held
to what isn't mine. Music is truly the
sound of our time, since it is how we most
deeply recognise the home we may not
have: the loss is trust and you could
reverse that without change.
With such
patience maybe we can listen to the rain
without always thinking about rain, we
trifle with rhyme and again is the
sound of immortality. We think we have
it & we must, for the sacred resides in this;
once more falling into the hour of my birth, going
down the hill and then in at the back door.

A Sonnet to Famous Hopes
Then the mind fills with snow the
tree, open syllables of reward. All the
limbs respond, to this my eyes see, there
the sense of an immense patch—the north
atlantic wake. A line of scrubby trees, those
fields still not ready but the snow, is still
the physical rain. Also hopeless, as if dead
with strain and every nerve, in the dismal
cathedral a grey waste. But the freedom plant
springs alert, in its curious way and reserved
in guesswork, now in biblical sequence. O
Jerusalem you are no less than this, Cairo
and Massachusetts, trust your eyes only
when they fill with more than, the price of
what you see. As what I feel about it &
meanwhile, the retinal muscle is bound to
another world, the banks of snow are
immense. The patch of salvation, so we are
too late not paranoid or jewish yet but
the snow fills, me with reward & with me, the
road is the tariff: above all then great
banks of cloud tether my elate muscle, to
nothing less & its fields—still fresh & green.

101

Whose Dust Did You Say
How old how far & how much the
years tear at us the shreds of cloth as
I think of them and the great palaces
with courts & the sounds of mirth
merriment in the darkness within the
great dream of the night. I live still
with the bitter habits of that fire &
disdain I live in it surrounded by
little else who can impair or bound
that empire of destined habitation
or go off into that coyly drab town
by slow stages or by any other damn
thing else who can who would waste
his time who would fritter his time
away how the years now do encircle
the season and when is a wage a
salary by dead reckoning from the
merest centre of the earth the
mere & lovely centre, of the earth.

A Dream of Retained dolour
Wt take up with the black branch
in the street, it is our support and
control, what wc do with life in
the phase now running on. From here
each time the glitter does settle out,
around some lamp, some fried-up
commercial scene we live in
support of and for. Who is this
that may just do the expected
thing; not the magic silence
of the inward eye you may be quite
positive. TV beams romantically into
the biosphere, plant food is our
daily misery. Mine: light & easy,
the victim-path is so absurd.
Misery is that support & control: the
force of sympathy is a claim no one
can pay for. We are indeed supplanted
and I know the light is all bribery',
daylight, electric, the matching stroke.
Uncertain whether the stars of my
inner canopy are part of this
brittle crust I watch them often.
The moon is still silent, I count that
a favour unpurchased, but the
scintillant clusters are the true test:
how much then are
we run, managed by
the biograph & predictive incision, it
must be possible to set the question
up & have it operational, in time
to restore the eye of fate: Lucifer, without any street lamps or TV. The
branch is rained on, it does nothing,
the event is unresponsive / & attending

103

to such infantile purchase is the
murderous daily income of sympathy.
The stars then being
ideas without windows, what should we
do by watching, is
it true: is it true? Starlight is the
new torture, seraphic host, punishment
of the visionary excess. What else, they
glide with their income intact, how often
they travel. What they do in this
social favour, that and how with, is
it true. The prism
of mere life is unbearable, plants and
animals in their
saecular changes, eaten up with will-power.
Who would believe in the victim, as, in
such general diversion, who would need to.
O you who drive past in my dream-car
of the century, lead me by no still waters,
don't touch me with the needle. I'm watching no one, the torture is immaculate and
conserved, I'd love to go so much it
isn't true it
really isn't true.

l o o t and Mouth
Every little shift towards comfort is a manoeuvre
of capital loaned off into the jungle of interest: see
how the banks celebrate their private season, with
brilliant swaps across the Atlantic trapeze. Such delicate abandon: we hold ourselves comfortingly braced
beneath, a safety-net of several millions & in what
we shall here call north Essex the trend is certainly
towards ease, time off to review those delicious values
traced in frost on the window or which wage-labour
used to force to the Friday market. Actually as I look
out the silly snow is collapsing into its dirty self
again, though I don't feel the cold as I have thoughtfully taped out the draughts with Pressure Sensitive
Tape (also known as RUBAN ADHESIF and NASTRO AD
HESIVO). Thus my own sphere of interest, based on a
quite sharp fahrenheit differential, contains no trace
of antique posture; I'm waiting for the soup to boil
and even the slow, pure, infinitely protracted recall
of a train-ride in northern Ontario (the Essex of north
America) can't fully divert me from the near prospect
of Campbell's Cream of Tomato Soup, made 1 see at
King's Lynn, Norfolk. Another fine local craft, you
don't need to believe all you read about the N e w York
art industry: "the transfer of capitalistic production
to the foreign market frees the latter completely from
the limitations imposed by its own consumer capacity."
And note that completely here, as I do while looking at
this dirty cold patch of road and suchlike, thinking
of cree indians and their high-bevelled cheeks &
almost ready for my skilfully seasoned lO^oz. treat.
No one in Minnesota would believe, surely, that the dollar
could still be whipping up tension about this? I am
assured by this thought and by the freedom it brings,
& by the garishly French gold medal won by my soup in 1900.

107

Star Damage at Home
The draft runs deeper now & the motion
relaxes its hold, so that I pass freely from
habit to form and to the sign complete
without unfolding-the bright shoots in the
night sky or the quick local tremor of leaves.
Where this goes is a scattered circle, each
house set on a level and related by time
to the persons whose lives now openly
have them in train. Each one drawn in
by promise recalled, just as the day itself
unlocks the white stone. Rain as it
falls down turns to the level of name, the
table slanting off with its concealed glint.
And what is the chance for survival, in this
fertile calm, that we could mean what
we say, and hold to it? That some star
not included in the middle heavens should
pine in earth, not shine above the skies and
those cloudy vapours? 1'hat it really should
burn with fierce heat, explode its fierce &
unbearable song, blacken the calm it comes
near. A song like a glowing rivet strikes
out of the circle, we must make room for
the celestial victim; it is amongst us and
fallen with hissing fury into the ground. Too
lovely the ground and my confidence as I
walk so evenly above it: we must mean the
entire force of what we shall come to say.
I cannot run with these deeply implicit
motions, the person is nothing, there should be
torture in our midst. Some coarsely exploited
money-making trick, fast & destructive, shrill
havoc to the murmur of names. The
blaze of violent purpose at least, struck
through : light : we desire what we mean
& wc must mean that & consume to

108

ash any simple deflection:
I will not be led
by the meaning of my
tinsel past or
this fecund hint
I merely live in. Destruction is too
good for it, like Cassius I flaunt the path
of some cosmic disaster. Fix the eye on
the feast of hatred forcing the civil war
in the U.S., the smoke towering above the
mere words splitting like glass into the
air. The divinity of light spread through
the day, the mortal cloud like no more than
heat haze, that thing is the idea of blood
raised to a final snow-capped abstraction. I
mean what the name has in its charge,
being not deceived by the dispersal which
sets it down. We live in compulsion, no
less, we must have the damage by which
the stars burn in their courses, we take/
set/twist/dispose of the rest. There is
no pause, no mild admixture. This is to
crush it to the centre, the angelic song shines
with embittered passion; there is no price
too high for the force running uncontrolled
into the cloud nearest the earth. We live here
and must mean it, the last person we are.

109

O n e Way At Any Time
Through the steamcd-up windows it says
"Thermal Insulation Products" I can't see
where it's come from, as the warm steamy
sound puffs out from the jukebox. The girl
leans over to clear off my plate, hey I've not
finished yet, the man opposite without thinking says must be on piecework and his
regular false teeth gleam like sardines. But
the twist here is that it's all in that yokel
talk they have for the rustics and this man
is in overalls, his boy about nine silent
beside him. The driver opposite looks as
if from some official car, he carries unworn
black leather gloves & wears a black cap,
with a plastic vizor. He has a watchchain across his waistcoat and a very
metallic watch on his wrist—he is not
functional in anything but the obvious
way but how will he too speak? McCormick International rumbles past
in truly common dialect, diesel in lowgear but the boy is still quiet. His teeth are
the real thing, crooked incisors as he
bites into B & B his father's mate sways
with natural endorsement back and forward
in his chair left by six he says and I don't
know whether a.m. or p.m. The girl shouts
and the young driver in uniform gives
an urban, movie-style flick of a nod as
he pushes back his chair it is Bristol it
is raining I wish I were Greek and could
trust all I hear but suppose anyway
that one of them turned out to be Irish?

110

Acquisition of Love
The children rise and fall as they
watch, they burn in the sun's coronal
display, each child is the fringe
and he advances at just that blinding
gradient. As I try to mend the broken
mower, its ratchet jammed somewhere
inside the crank-case, I feel the
blood all rush in a separate spiral,
each genetically confirmed in the
young heartlands beyond. The curious
ones have their courses set towards
fear and collapse, faces switch on and
off, it is not any image of learning
but the gene pool itself defines these
lively feelings. I get the casing off,
sitting on the flat stone slab by the
front door, you would think fortunes
could be bom here and you would
be wrong. Their childish assertion is
bleeding into the centre, we are determined
that they shall do this: they look outwards
to our idea of the planet. Their blood
is battered by this idea, the rules for
the replication of pattern guide their dreams
safely into our dreams. The two ratchets
are both rusted in; I file out their
slots and brush out the corroded
flakes with oil. They watch, and
what they watch has nothing to do
with anything. What they do is an
inherited print, I lend it to them
just by looking & only their blood
seems to hold out against the complete
neuro chemical entail. I guess their
capacity in pints, the dream like membranes
which keep their faces ready to see. The
mower works now, related to nothing
but the hand and purpose, the fear of
collapse is pumped round by each linked
system & the borrowed warmth of the heart.

111

Questions tor the Time Being

«

All right then no stoic composure as the
self-styled masters of language queue up to
apply for their permits. That they own and
control the means of production (or at least
the monopoly of its more dangerous aspects)
seems not to have struck home. But it
must, or hysterical boredom will result and
we shall all think that creative paranoia
has now finally reached these shores—and as
if we didn't invent it anyway, as Wvndham
Lewis tried so fiercely to explain. And in the
face of the "new frankness" in immaculate
display in the highest places, why should
the direct question not be put: if any discrete
class with an envisaged part in the social process
is not creating its own history, then who is doing
it for them? Namely, what is anyone waiting
for, either resigned or nervous or frantic from
time to time? Various forms dodge through
the margins of a livelihood, but so much talk
about the underground is silly when it would require a constant effort to keep below the surface,
when almost everything is exactly that, the
mirror of a would-be alien who won't see how
much he is at home. In consequence also the
idea of change is briskly seasonal, it's too cold
& thus the scout-camp idea of revolution stands
in temporary composure, waiting for spring. All
forms of delay help this farce, that our restrictions
arc temporary & that the noble fiction is to have
a few good moments, which represent what wc know
ought to be ours. Ought to be, that makes me
wince with facetiousness: we/you/they. all the
pronouns by now know how to make a sentence
work with ought to, and the stoic at least saves
himself that extremity of false vigilance.
Yet living in hope is so silly when our desires
are so separate, not part of any mode or condition except language & there they rest on

112

(lu- false mantclpieee, like ornaments of style.
And expectancy is equally silly when what we think
of is delay, or gangsterism of the moment, some
Micawberish fantasy that we can snatch the controls
when the really crucial moment turns up. Not without asbestos gloves we can't, the wheel is permanently
red-hot, no one on a new course sits back and
switches on the automatic pilot. Revisionist plots
are everywhere and our pronouns haven't even
drawn up plans for the first coup. Really it's
laughable & folks talk of discontent or waiting
to see what they can make of it. How much
cash in simple gross terms went through the
merger banks in the last three months? Buy one
another or die; but the cultured elite, our squad
of pronouns with their lingual backs to the wall,
prefer to keep everything in the family. The upshot is simple & as follows: 1. No one has any right
to mere idle discontent, even in conditions of most
extreme privation, since such a state of arrested
insight is actively counter-productive; 2. Contentment or sceptical calm will produce
instant death at the next jolt & intending
suicides should carry a card at least exonerating
the eventual bystanders; 3- What goes on in a
language is the corporate & prolonged action
of worked self-transcendence—other minor verbal
delays have their uses but the scheme of such
motives is at best ambiguous; 4. Luminous
take-off shows through in language forced into any
compact with the historic shift, but in a given condition such as now not even elegance will come
of the temporary nothing in which life goes on.

113

Starvation / Dream
The fire still glides down
in the hearth, the pale season
and the leaky boat drops
slowly downstream. Like emeralds
the remote figure of a
remote capital gain: the case
of fire rests in a flicker, just
short of silence. So the dream
still curls in its horizon of
total theft, cooled by the misty
involvement of dew, and at once
it is clear, finally, that this
is not our planet: we have come
to the wrong place. We steal
everything we have—why elseare we driven by starved passion
to the dishonour of force? The
Russian trick was to bum up
wads of banknotes, so as to
clear the imperial stain, the hedged
& tree-lined avenues of our desires.
And what we dream we want is
the whole computed sum of plants and
animals of this middle world, the
black lands called up by our
patient & careful visits. By any
ritual of purpose we extend the idea
of loan and we dream of it, the
payment of all our debts. But we
never shall, we have no single gain
apart from the disguise of how far
we say we earn. The ground outside mistily involves itself with its
contour, the leaky boat glides down
the morning flood, in this rival
dream all our enemies are with us
and the animals & plants shall
take nourishment from the same
silent and passionless table.

114

Smaller than the Ratlins of the Planet
There is a patch like ice in the sky this
evening & the wind tacks about, we arcboth stopped/fingered by it. I lay out my
unrest like white lines on the slope, so that
something out of broken sleep will land
there, l.ook up. a vale of sorrow opened byeyes anywhere above us, the child spread out
in his memory of darkness. And so, then, the
magnetic influence of Venus sweeps its
shiver into the heart/brain or hypothalamus,
we are still here, I look steadily at nothing.
The gradient of the decrease may be determined byr the spread in intrinsic luminosities "—the ethereal language of love in
brilliant suspense between us and the
hesitant are. Yet I need it too and keep
one hand in my pocket & one in yours,
waiting for the first snow of the year.

115

Crown
The hours are taken slowly out of the
city and its upturned faces—a rising fountain
quite slim and unflowering as it
is drawn off. The arrangements of work
swell obscurely round the base of the
Interior Mountain, in the pale house with
its parody of stairs. The air is cold; a
pale sunlight is nothing within the con
strictions of trust in the throat, in
the market-place. Or the silver police
station, the golden shops, all holy in this
place where the sound of false shouts too
much does reconcile the face and hands.
Yet the feet tread about in the dust, cash slides
& crashes into the registers, the slopes
rise unseen with the week and can still
burn a man up. Each face a purging
of venom, an absent coin, oh why as the
hours pass and are drawn off do the
shoulders break, down to their possessions,
when at moments and for days the city
is achieved as a glance—inwards, across,
the Interior Mountain with its cliffs
pale under frost. And the question rises
like helium in its lightness, not held down
by any hands, followed by the faces disowned by the shoes & overcoat settling in
behind the wheel and pulling the door shut.
Thus the soul's discursive fire
veers with the wind; the love
of any man is turned
by the mere and cunning front:
No hand then but to coin, no
face further than
needs be, the sounds fall
quickly into the gutters:

116

And from this the waters thin into their
ascendant vapour, the pillar of cloud; it
stands over the afternoon already halfdark. No one is fearful, I see them all
stop to look into the sky and my famished
avowals cast the final petals. It is the
Arabian flower of the century, the question
returned upon itself; the action of month and
hour is warm with cinnamon & clear water,
the first slopes rise gently at our feet.

117

Love

Noble in the sound which
marks the pale ease
of their dreams, they ride
the bel canto of our
time: the patient encirclement of Narcissus &
as he pines I too
am wan with fever,
have fears which set
the vanished child above
reproach. Cry as you
will, take what you
need, the night is young
and limitless our greed.

118

Night Song
The white rose trembles by the step it is
uncalled for in the fading daylight and
tiny plants sprout from between the stones
Soon Mizar will take the tawny sky
into protection they will soon be calling
for the sick ones and all our passing
sounds will rise into the horn and be
cast outwards scattered the scale rises
like a tide and the frail craft is afloat
Who would believe it yet the waters are
rough and the seabirds fly unblinking as
if wind were the ointment they wished for
Come back to the step I call as the house
turns and it is almost night but there is
no end to the peace claimed by the sick
body and no relief for the mere lack of
fever by which now I lean from the step
and touch at the bare twigs with my wrist

119

A Stone Called Nothing
Match the stone, the milk running in the
middle sea, take your way with them. The way
is the course as you speak, gentle chatter:
the lights dip as the driver presses the
starter & the bus pulls away to leave
for the moonstruck fields of the lower paid.
Gentle chatter, match the stone, we are
running into the sea. Pay your fare, have
the road beamed out:
nay, eat as much
bread as you find, and leave the wide earth
to pursue its way; go to the brink of the
river, and drink as much as you need, and
pass on, and seek not to know whence
it comes, or how it flows.
A good course
in the middle sea. we swing into a
long rising bend. The equinox is our line for
the present, who is to love that: the thought
dries off into the arch ready for it. Faintest
of stellar objects, I defy you and yet this
devastation curls on, out over the road. Are
we so in the black frost, is this what we pay
for as the ruined names fade into Wilkes land,
its "purity of heart "?
Do your best to have your
foot cured, or the disease of your eye, that you
may see the light of the sun, but do not enquire
how much light the sun has. or how high it
rises.
The devastation is aimless; folded without recompense, change down to third do any
scandalous thing, the gutters run with milk.
The child of any house by the way is something
to love, I devise that as an appeal to Vulcan, to
open the pit we cannot fall into. Failure
without falling, the air is a frozen passage,
the way bleached out, we are silent now. The
child is the merest bent stick; I cannot move.
There should be tongues of fire & yet now

120

the wipers arc going, at once a tliin rain is
sucked into the glass, oil I'll trust anything.
The babe, when it comes to its mother's breast,
takes the milk and thrives, it does not search
for the root and well-spring from which it
flows so. It sucks the milk and empties
the whole measure
: listen to the sound yet
we go on moving, the air is dry, 1 seem
to hear nothing. It is for the time an aimless

John in the Blooded Phoenix
Days arc uncertain now and move by
flux gradients laid by the rare minerals, sodium in dreams of all the body
drawn into one transcendent muscle:
the dark shopfront at 3 a.m. But
we are close to the ancient summits
of a figure cast for the age. the gasfire we sit by, the sharp smell of burning
orange-peel. The axis of landform runs
through each muted interchange, the
tilt is a plausible deflexion of energy / now
we are not at the side of anything.
In the vision made by memories of metal
we walk freely as if by omen over an
open terrace, of land like chalky
sediment in soft water. It is the gas-fire
that does it, I despise nothing which
comes near a skyline as old as this.
We could pace in our own fluids, we speak
in celestial parlance, our chemistry is
reduced to transfusion. Who would forbid fair Cleopatra smiling / on his poor
soul, for her sweet sake still dying? If
he were he is, the condition of prompt
dilatancy is exactly this: the palest
single spark in all the Pleiades.

Chcmins ilc Fcr
It is a forest of young pines and now we
are eating snow in handfuls, looking at the
towers which when the light topsoil is warm
again will carry the firewatchers. From here there
is no simple question of preparing to leave, or
making our way. Even the thinnest breath of
wind wraps round the intense lassitude, that
an undeniably political centre keeps watch; the
switch of light and shadow is packed with
foreign tongues. I shall not know my own
conjecture. The plants stare at my ankles in
stiffness, they earn- names I cannot recognise.
Yet in the air, still
now, I am claimed
by the memory of
how the join, the
incessant lapping, is
already reported in
talk to a human figure. Again he is
watchful, the dream slides right up to the
true Adam and he keeps silent among the
branches. The approach, here, of streamy recall
seems like the touch of Europe, an invert logic
brought in with too vivid a pastoral sense,
too certain for Alsace, the double eagle or the
Gulf of Lions. He is a dark outline, already
struck by sacred
emptiness. Fie goes
slowly, her body
fades into reason,
the memory evergreen and planted,
like the lost child.
And so slowly, still, draining gradually into
the Rhine, the huge barges freeze in the heat
of trade. How much power, the machine gun in
a Polish scenario, black and white fade into those
passionless excursions of childhood. The small
copse, water rusted in, an adventure! With which
the flimsy self pivots in wilful envy and lusts
after its strange body, its limbs gorged & inert.

As It W e r e An Attendant

'

Proceeding still in the westward face, and like
a life underwater: that facade
sheer and abrupt,
the face in all that shot towards venus, march
on the pentagon, all the prodigious cycle of ages.
Going on then any person still frequent, fixed by
the sun in that cuclidean concept of "day", takes
a pause and at once is the face
or some account
of it: mostly we are so rushed. Harassment is
not on the switch, playback of the perfect
darling
and late again—we can begin with the warm up
about the politics of melody / that one, and
please you say at once, not again.
By the face
we converse about stars, starlight & their twinkle,
since sweetly it subsides and by proceeding,
a long file above water, single
laced after this
jabber we keep it
all going, at one time
it is just that,

gone; the
rest is some
pale & Cheshire
face. Conspicuous
by its rays & terrible and grand this
is not our feeling
as blindly I tread to find myself
out of it, running
on before them, accompanying them and
going with them,
there, as I have not known for months,
standing by a hedge: "I
love the shipwrecked man who was betrayed
by misfortune." As a cork rammed in the
century's neck, I see at once the faces who have
unsuccessfully dogged my path-the procession

The Corn Burned by Syrius
Leave it with the slender distraction, again this
is the city shaken down to its weakness. Washed-out
green so close to virtue in the early morning,
than which for the curving round to home this
is the fervent companion. The raised bank by
the river, maximum Veritas, now w e have no
other thing. A small red disc quivers in the street,
we watch our conscious needs swing into this point
and vanish; that it is more cannot be found, no
feature, where else could we go. The distraction
is almost empty, taken up with nothing; if the two
notes sounded together could possess themselves, be
ready in their own maximum: "O how fan-cart thou gone from thy Country', not being
driven away, but wandring of thine owne accord."
On the bank an increase of sounds, and walk through
the sky the grass, that any motion is the first
settlement. We plant and put down cryptic slopes
to the damp grass, this passion fading off to the
intensely beaten path: that it should be possessed
of need & desire coiled into the sky, and then dismembered into the prairie twitching with herbs,
pale, that it is the city nin out and retained
for the thousands of miles allowed, claimed to be so.

A NOTE ON METAL
[1968]

f

The early Bronze Age would, I suppose, locate the beginnings
of Western alchemy, the theory of quality as essential. The
emergence of metal technologies (smelting &. beating, followed
by knowledge of alloys) was clearly a new way with the magical
forms through which property resided in substance. Until this
stage, weight was the most specific carrier for the inherence of
power, and weight was and is a mixed condition, related locally
to exertion. The focus of this condition is typically stone; and
though this seems most obviously to insist on the compact outer
surface, in fact it provides the most important practical & cultic
inside, the cave. The privilege of that ambiguity about surface
gives the painted rock-shelter and the mcgalithic chamber-tomb
the power of formal change, and in this way substance can be
extended, by incorporation, to allow the magical and political/social presences their due place.
Whereas with copper, tin (and perhaps antimony), weight
coincides with other possible conditions which are less mixed
and specific: brightness, hardness, ductility and general ease of
working. And further, the abstraction of property (characterised
as formal rather than substantive) makes the production of alloys
a question of technique in the most theoretical sense.1 Bronze
may have been known to the Sumerians at a very early stage, and
yet tin is rare in the Near East and must have been imported over
considerable distances. The difference between the kinds of
intent supporting the movement of bluestones from Pembrokeshire to Wessex, and the Sumerian acquisition of tin from
Cornwall or Bohemia, must be obvious.
And through the agency of the most ostensive control of force,
namely fire, sword-blades or spear-heads could be forged into a
strength infinitely more abstract than the flaking of high-quality
flint or the hardening of wooden points. The new quality thus
gained was sharp and killed with new speed and power, from a
long range. Animal hides could be sewn up with metal bodkins
and fish taken with fine wire hooks; the metal ploughshare could
cut deeper into the soil and with less effort. 2 The new quality of
spiritual transfer was concentrated in these most durable forms
of leading edge, seen especially in the flattened motive of
ornament, and the history of substance (stone) shifts with
complex social implication into the theory of power (metal).
That's a deliberately simplified sketch, because it may well be
that this theorising of quality, with its control over weaponry and
tillage and hence over life, induced a deeper cultural adherence
to substance as the zone of being in which the condition was

128

also limit: the Interior knowledge of dying. By death I mean here
in particular those forms of life and ritual, the extension of body,
in which persistence through material transmutation was an egoterm (even when socialised) rather than one concerned chiefly
with the outer world (enemies or animals hunted for food, flesh
as object). So that stone becomes the power-substance marking
the incorporated extensions of dying, and is still so as a
headstone is the vulgar or common correlative of a hope for the
after-life.
And in parallel with this reactive development (maybe, an
e x i l i c theory of substance) c o m e s the rapid advance of
metallurgy, shifting from the transfer of life as power (hunting)
into the more settled expectation of reaping what you havealready sown: this itself produces the idea of place as the chief
local fact, which makes mining and the whole extractive industry
possible from then on. The threshing of millet or barley must
bring a purer' and more abstract theory' of value; the mixed
relativism of substance leads, by varied but in outline predictable
stages, to value as a specialised function and hence as dependent
on the rate of exchange. The Sumerian settlement was founded
on the innovations of metallurgy, and these abstractions of
substance were in turn the basis for a politics of wealth, the
concentration of theoretic power by iconic displacement of
substance. The unit of exchange was still the ingot by weight and
not yet coins by number, but we are already in what Childe
called a money economy' as opposed to a natural economy":
there is already a code of practice for capital loaned out on
interest.5
For a long time the magical implications of transfer in any
shape must have given a muted and perhaps not initially debased
sacrality to objects of currency-status, just as fish-hooks and
bullets became strongly magical objects in the societies formed
around their use. But gradually the item-form becomes iconized,
in transitions like that from aes rude (irregular bits of bronze),
through aes signatum (cast ingots or bars) to aes grave (the
circular stamped coin). The metonymic unit is established, and
number replaces strength or power as the chief assertion of
presence. In consequence, trade-routes undergo a dramatic
expansion, since mercantile theory operates with the most
conspicuous success when employed over large inter-cultural
distances: "In the Early Bronze Age peninsular Italy, Central
Europe, the West Baltic Coastlands. and the British Isles were
united by a single system for the distribution of metalware,

129

rooted in the Aegean market. "'
The clearest instance of this type of change arises probably
where a more 'sophisticated' and progressive' economy meets
an idiom of change and value less efficiently abstracted. The
mercantile contact between the sea-borne traders of the Eastern
Mediterranean and the peoples of the Anatolian hinterland can
show this interaction already by the late Bronze Age (for this
region, c. 16(X) B.C.). On the great alluvial plains of Asia the
c o n d i t i o n was one of p o w e r rather than value; that is,
substance, and not (in the first instance) transfer as exchange.
Flocks and herds can be stolen, bartered, given in gift or tribute,
so that wealth for the most part is the power of a technique to
hold all that, again the politics of limit. Whereas the Greek
traders were already middlemen with no political standing,
Sardis no city but a commercial centre working on the trick of
abstract distance between real supply and real demand. Lydia,
as Childe again said, was "a frontier kingdom o w i n g its
prosperity to transit trade."5
Here finally, and for the first time (according to tradition)
arises sheer mercantile distance in the form of coin, where the
magical resonance of transfer is virtually extinct: "That coined
m o n e y should have been e v o l v e d here [the Eastern
Mediterranean] is not surprising, for it was an area of intense
commercial activity, encouraged and fostered by natural
advantages. The Lydians, 'the first shopkeepers' as Herodotus
called them, as well as the neighbouring Ionians, received
goods from the caravan routes and river communications across
Asia. They had access to safe and sheltered harbours for easy
coastwise trade. They exported their famous Chian wines, their
purple dye which gave its name to Erythrae, and their Samian
pots, but above all they were renowned for their gold, which
provided the fabulous wealth of Croesus, and still more
fabulous wealth of Midas." 6 And Croesus, the first recorded
millionaire, is also the first to devise a bimetallic currency,
w h e r e even the theoretic properties of metal are further
displaced, into the stratified functionalism of a monetary
system. We are almost completely removed from presence as
weight, and at this point the emergence of a complete middle
class based on the technique of this removal becomes a real
possibility. So that by this stage there is the possible contrast of
an exilic (left-wing) history of substance.
And yet the shifts are off-set and multiple, and in the earlier
stages are accompanied by extensions of awareness newly

130

sharpened by exactly that risk 1'he literal is not magic, lor (Inmost part, and it s how the power of displacement side slipped
into some entirely other interest which is difficult, not a simple
decision that any one movement is towards ruin. Stone is
already the abstraction of standing, of balance; and dying is still
the end of a man's self-enrichment, the reason' why he does it.
The North American Indians developed no real metallurgy at all,
at any stage of their history.7 The whole shift and turn is not
direct (as Childe, too insistently, would have us believe), but
rather the increasing speed of displacement which culminates
only later in a critical overbalance of intent.8 If we are confident
over the more developed consequences, at the unrecognised
turn we are still at a loss to say where or why.

131

Notes
' Some of the earliest British metal-technologies have been held to include
techniques of "smelting, alloying, casting, hammering, grinding and polishing,
work in repousse with punches, traced ornament, perforation with a punch
and perhaps also by drilling, riveting, probably the use of a mandrel, and most
likely an empirical skill in the exploitation of work-hardening and annealing"

Bronze Age of Britain," Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, N. S. XXIX

been argued that the original intention was not so much in the first place to
facilitate trade (external or internal), but rather to establish a system of
centralised national wealth which could support a professional military caste;

A n d Only Fortune Shines
Wc arc not the person for this as we
do make away / over to the / side I
tell you oh love the ones
we are the touch of, as
going in the dark, why
should it be less. I will keep down
to the damp ground, splayed in the
faint hope it is love when in this last
passion I see we are then who we
love, in the open. Cheeks
ever puffed with hollow
pieties, the wild flames
feeding from the
star in the forehead. Each while he
hurts, where the brief turn & coil
of the chin, eyes for me the
t

other, the mild
trust. She stands
swaying as I know her
in the beauty of that,
one voice containing the other.
I will go on with this: daylight slides
into the bloodstream, how can we
hold what we are
So I sec the
other come in, the
slight figure
buckled in close and pale oh lady
be the present figure of what I
do feel & will go to. over tiltglance in the dark
the passage, footfall as she stands
or runs now, up the steps. They breathe
the air there is, we are not short
of any thing. We love what we
trust it is the coming age of
the face, oh please do
set this in the sight
I must have. The per-

Poem in Time to This
At that moment the tone of the
first sound came to me, walking
under the changing cloud cover,
up past the place of rise and turn I
know so well. Like water it is
the continuance of opinion; if the
green comes on again or we fall as
we pass through what we know
already, this is truly our pace
for the joy of season. In my own time
I too choose to defer and expand,
my limbs loose like the gradual
& cancelled reason: call it "the
purpose of the self'. So chastely
the sound ministers to the ease
of motion, I walk knowing the
whole past like a single brown shell.
If it is the absent sea, I have never
seen that, I am at this present
time in no rage for the real noise,
clatter of shingle etc. The first
sound is enough, I do nothing but
know as I walk, past the new
green and rise to the fertile crest,
that my feelings are all given away,
the murmur lost to the ear.

136

East-South-East
And so it is the figure, gleaming on the path,
the person who shines in the torrents of fresh
rain. That rushing sound is already lifted
as if being carried over, taken so slowly that
the rate is birth. Struck into
birth, into lightning and so
slow the touch not at all wild.
The slowness is what's strange, as if the
washing were a coin ready for the soul,
the shining road just a surface to years,
to the years & their raiment kept out
and folded. The light pleating
the rain. Coming from Hitchin
the way twisted under some
trees & I met there the Shining One. No
conversation or investment followed, the
rain was incessant; there was a completely
steady flow of changc. The damp was ionised,
with charges slipping down quite
unmatched paths, it was a most
beautiful and painless night.
And there is nothing to rescue, where the figure
may stay & receive wine with the blood of a white
hind, on the A 602 and the shelter of
the journey. Nothing to save, we shine, we also
shine in our neglect.

137

Hey Oswald
He wanders inertly, with a shrewd
unattending absence,
his being on a thin
stalk: he twists
from reluctance to
keep to the one plane
when his name comes
in sound, to him
The light bracing
of muscle confronts
him, already he
has that instinct:
connected to the
shadow, draw what
is yours into the
evidence, of person
But the sun most
marks it, by a
sudden flashing on
and off, going black
from the centre like
a flower rotting: this
is the stable sign
by which the world
insists in the one
ecliptic
He is there
at loss, knowing the
world to be so: his
youth now the
sentiment drawn off
by his being
so, by his first
name: by his
owning his thought
(his coming end)

138

H o w Many T h e r e Are: A Letter
Even to wait slowly, as with the one word 'far'
is the reach of a number theory, the art attached to
that extension of the holy war. As I walk down
the fold in the banks, following the water is an
axis, the flow brushes the leaves and houses
into the channel, the progress of relevance; which is
I know about that, more familiar in these parts.
But where, in some
sense I might other-

wise be is the
number I live with,
who is the three in
my hand, always so
hungry for it
at the break; or even the pure form of change.
The greedy halo is the enlargement of similar
things (included in likeness). There are five, the
air is moist round the just visible moon, you
could double and split the very birds of the field.
Three is the means
of survival and five
is its consort; it arises
as a permission from
who one is, a nonfinite proliferation
of tireless limbs.
If the road be crossed (or traversed), the break so
caused is a fault in creation. We must move
carefully again & magic is the presence of form
without number. As if that weren't as old-fashioned
as exactly it sounds. Each time I go the same
way the file of occasion increases: perhaps we
should just grow more
solemn. Yet I know
you are there, finding
the five steps of my
entire life, we stay in
the figure & can afford to count nothing else.

139

I'.S. This may be just sentiment. But If we
think so, the term is still our claim, the form of
water & I do hope at least very much, for that.

past the bridle,
the bodiless parterre
shakes the sleeve. There
I believe what you say.

142

Oh small lamp of the
scarlet, tell me: the front
rests by the sky. We too
seek perfect pitch.
Cracking nuts, leaning
either way you sav so.

Bright shadows point
under the snow. The
intelligence is not even
held under. The new
thing cries like a cat.
Shew me sweet with
the fingers

143

for that's enough.
The proem strides off
as breakfast by the
plate washed over;
oiling the shell,
ringing the bell.

I cannot part you, try
as I often do. The hour
snaps up my tinder bank
and where will be
the last of her

which is the step.

Or care what the cave
says, who said it.
Burning the gum while
the bird made solemn mock.
He says balsam in
defence, warningly on.

Are you hurt now,
scalded anywhere on
the arm. I take your
part my Russian winter,
ice on the stream. On
the formal disclaimer,

146

that's so too. Banded opal
in the mouth of June, why

rattles over the crossing.

Still I love you.
That's the reason too.

The Bee Target on his Shoulder
Gratefully they evade the halflight
rising for me, on the frosty abyss.
Rub your fingers with chalk and
grass, linctus over the ankle, now TV with
the sound off & frame hold in
reason beyond that. Paste. Thereby take
the foretaste of style, going naked
wherever commanded, by
the father struck
in the plain. His
wavy boots glow
as he matches
the headboard.
Do not love this man. He makes
Fridays unbearable, with the
ominous dullness of the gateway
to the Spanish garden. His
herb-set teeth are impossible,
tropic to R.E.M. and the white doll.
It's all so prognostic: he wakes inclined to say just that. But then he
stretches / beyond / the
silent floating torpor of
stupefaction, flesh
pierced & stripped like
comb honey.
Water the
ground with song, aria
with cloud, that's his
aunt with the brown teapot jammed
into edible, macerated crumpet. So you
shrilled unwittingly in the 3rd chorus.
Oh he wants no more but bright
honour sparkling in his eye, he
flies into pungent happiness.
He insists, rather grandly, that this
is "right" for him. The greedy mule
recoils from Salamanca, still won't eat.
And after rain the

150

mild rushes shoot
for you and command the house
to be built at once.
Red and grey as
they come. In the sheen
of dew his socks are wet and the
tincture stains his instep indeed.
The head film matches the conduit
with banal migraine. Father pokes
about for the gay snuff of Algiers.
Together we love him limb from
limb, walking in the moonlight;
moderate SW gales do nothing but
blandish the same story.
Which is
spelled from birdsong anyway,
say indeed under cumin,
fetlock, going out and
gentle with the
prime order
of frost and reason, reason and frost,
the same stormy inconsequence. A patch
of wanting is not singing successfully,
the adverbs of a spate are too like, well,
ecriture fatale. The ring is on the other
wall of the shop.
The plaster ceiling is
clear and true.
Say so, as a median
nature, up the sad trellis.
Say you do, lighting the
"sacred squadron",
flat on their faces.
The wall
of the shop has a blue tablet, in
memory of ATV Channel Nine. On this
bonny bank father pauses, to empty
his boots of seedlings and filthy change.
A rash of invasion follows, in
strict order of love; first the new
non-vintage, then casually sitting
out in the garden atop the grass.

"If he cats the flesh of his hand: his

is costly, like rime. I mean, day after dayis sunk into the river & washed
like palest blue Reinheit into the last

wolf-tallow is
smeared on his
lower lip. It is
dear to be left
calm in face of the house and the night. If
it is dark and cloudless, without stars, some
friendly woman will blunder with the tap.
No news can be less valued, by
derisive acts
of mercy nonetheless; don t come
while I'm away with the sad
touches of sulphur. Rain.
The water is rose-blue also and gentle while
mist curls into his daughter and she
receives it pleasantly, muting the comic scowl.
Bravely she traces
the path of father's boots
on the lawn—little
sister we sob merrily & settle down
by the newest grave: fresh
earth as the clay to see with,
standing by the head,
making the song with shadows set
over the reed-bed. That's
what they're for, seasons and for days and years in
the circle of teeth by the cosy fire. You know if you ask
that the air terminal

Euphoric gloom writes itself off into
the air: some views are quite terrific hut
really I don't give a damn and
flimsy scorn-like sails scatter all
over the lake. It's like stencilled
cardboard again, ascending to its
lumpy clouds and the snow creeps into
meek sexy puffs, ready for morning.
And there
is this much more, as the march of
literary lancers pales in the mirror:
sweet nothing for lunch this time, yet another
talk about diamonds. What is this
glittery filth; not the factual remains
of desire, not refinements all over
again? Comic disbelief fractures
the glottis, glottal pauses, nothing
is in high season &
your tender looks are
frankly incredible
here
the prevailing sense of
occasion minces feelingly
to the meter and pops in another ketchup insult, beneath
which the spirit
labours uncontaminated by
you me or anyone but
the old man caressed by his
sweating animal chair. Here
zooms into view the new floor, spinning down
ready-dirtied with vengeance and catastrophe:
fate strikes! fainting members compose
"hope" and "trembling", mere watchers burst
into pieces!
That's what happens at the
harbour, that too is
rabid for trafficin
hilarious absolute daybreak or drop

The kir^hi/' Disasters
Hie news comes in from the Tarim Basin, that
the passes are blocked by fresh falls. Ice forms
upwards from the floors of gravel & inwards
from the sides, the train is halted by needs quite
unforeseen in its schedule. Rock tumbles in
pretty cascades. The base-line of the time is
money' quadrant shifts to take up new stress;
only the line of major ripple still twists
free, trapping air under the crystal. The muse
in reckless theophany gives a familiar yell:
juniper, moss agate, jurassic boredom glows in
the empty waiting-room. The fire is an unreal
mixture of smoke & damp; the reason for
this is unmusical, in stoic silence by the door.

Readable at Easter, the arrows flash to the lonely
mark and spell ruin quite quickly, in fact make
up the letters in triple nourishing layers. Beyond
this, light and some kind of extraction, the heartfelt sighs drawn off like grass—there's nothing in
the way of dawn with its bald patches, why don't the
men on the other side get up & do it? The heart
has its excuses, no friend waits who has not met
the postman half-way down the beach, calmly indifferent. Wake up wake up he shouts through the
open window and you reach for the time, feeling
the warm air & its wax. Otherwise the rest is just
absolute: right down at the foot of the buttress a mark
of wasted affection lies awry, all falling apart.

155

Clonic 011 in then, goes up a general shout, there's
still room & there is, who would trouble with the
freedom to dissent when there would be so much
respect to put up with—oh/oh/oh and off out into
the etc. Better far a lizard, an excursion special,
attracting the lowest rate of tax compatible with
unnoticed grace. Can smoke freeze? Without
warning the ice emits its periodic crackle, jumping
upwards like wall-paper, and searching the band
for another station reveals new liassic beds near
the previous shelf. So without tooting we depart, she
knowing all the while that freedom would just
leave her stranded again. The continent will of
course embrace us: we wound only, reluctant to kill.

The rider touches his hopeful cabin, in the form
of a child aged about seven months; the circle of
knowledge is unbroken. There is even price in
the air, its upward lift near to the limit.
The driver peers from his screen at the circle,
now leafy and flashing, the sign of the imposed
progress by late evening. Only the decision is
stopped: "the idea expressed is for any
of the three persons to deeply desire or hope
to do a difficult thing"—and they do. they always
run to the gate with news or make wide grabs
at the leaves as they whizz past the window.
What else is there: the captain orders the sight
of land to be erased from the log, as well he might.

Hell, not water creeping like afflicted soup into
the park, no prospects for renewing our tickets. The choice
commissar lifts his glove by the thumb and returns it to
the very short lady at the desk, legs deep in turbid
current: she can't stir yet either, she flips up
an eye in each socket. She is quite disdainful. The flocks
of songsters translate the old films into dirty little
blocks each time round, they "never think of removing a
single stone." They are zealots in the park all over,
they pick away his glove more than they watch for
the morning rush. And at that the fringes wither
with tight credal echoes, bringing fear into the homely
recital. Swear at the leather by the knee-joint
shouts Jerome, crumbs ready as a favoured bribe.

Then I eat a careful selection of food.
My fork skims thoughtfully from side to

each muscle shuts.

He now drops the heavenly coin in the doorway; under the
autumn heaps the battalion choir make twits and observe
the coin's unblemished descent. A flashing silver rivet
slips into the anthill on the bend. Conclusive appetite
is in that chorus of disaster, we shall call him me-me &
have done with it, crippled stick. And while replies
sprout between the bricks the hired contra-basso feels his
cheek with another finger, thinks of a note falling into
his auntie's purse. The choir is widely aroused, rises in
respectful attention. And the pain runs down his right
side, making him gasp: the traffic goes into twinges,
everything does this, flicking through knots, but the
really first question is still not warm. How could it be
as we turn quickly round and look at what you see.

8.

So that Jerome springs back into place, your friendly
dental technician trailing his new bridge-work. He is
esteemed always, loved to distraction, the first principles
of life must be "tender and ductile"; strip off, and
that too is rotten. The redeemed corset strains into view
again and we perk up finally by the counter. Tip tip
tip as the band refuses to watch, we don't like to
fix it so close to the keel. What to prune, come down
into the store-room. Or not this time, they all stroll in
from the drill and its wreckage: they are all here.
All disgustingly crouched along the spinet, they
spin, they catch at enamel, they gasp at the
pollen count. She next stuffs her little crown into a
bag and runs daintily upstairs, she nauseates everyone.

Tears streamed down his unlined face,

The Five lliiidranees
His canopy makes a new pallor; the crescent
strikes a high whistle as from the bridge over
the gap. How it displays itself, eating the
seed like cough sweets. Listen under the wheel,
from Mannheim to Trieste, what you hear is
wide air in chaos, dusted over and softened
like flesh. That's how we part, not caring, in
a blood spot absolute for destruction. We rise
and fall with hedge-trimmer's finesse, when
the step veers round to the east:
take what you hear slowly,
as water makes the sun
pale again, near the
scabious pinned out for
rescue. It cannot turn
back now in the room smelling of damp wood,
it is so far outreached, cross-bred with the future.
His former self wastes on the stair, putting oil
to each hinge in turn. N o w we come through
the air we breathe bemused by the week: the fire
of heaven, gentle, very light. The brilliant patch
(thorium) where the pilot touches the web and
"intersects the gross national product", undeserved
incest with the soft light of the planet. What is
this high street at night, in every direction the
same as itself? As it will not change but
pleads for its topical centre, rising to the cone
of wind and ash: fields of
pure inertia. He folds the
stem of his two cheeks to
this, he fans the servant with
scented leaves. The two friends
walk down the sandy track and we hold back
the ends of the crescent. The future history of the
air is glowing, with amity beyond the path itself;
touched gently and brought to this stubborn wreck.

The Ideal Star-Fighter
I
N o w a slight meniscus floats on the moral
pigment of these times, producing
displacement of the body image, the politic
albino. The faded bird droops in his
cage called fear and yet flight into
his pectoral shed makes for comic
hysteria, visible hope converted to the
switchboard of organic providence
at the tiny rate of say 0.25 per cent
"for the earth as a whole". And why
go on reducing and failing like metal: the
condition is man and the total crop yield
of fear, from the fixation of danger; in
how we are gripped in the dark, the
flashes of where we are. It pays to be
simple, for screaming out, the eye
converts the news image to fear enzyme,
we are immune to disbelief. "If there
is danger there ought to be fear ", translocation of the self to focal alert, "but
if fear is an evil why should there be
danger?" The meniscus tilts the
water table, the stable end-product is dark
motion, glints of terror the final inert
residue. Oriental human beings throw off
their leafy canopies, expire; it is
the unpastured sea hungering for calm.

165

II

And so we hear daily of the backward
glance at the planet, the reaction of
sentiment. Exhaust washes tidal flux
at the crust, the fierce acceleration
of mawkish regard. To be perceived with
such bounty! To put the ring-main of
fear into printed circuit, so that from the
distant loop of the hate system the
whole object is lovable, delicious, ingested
by heroic absorption! We should
shrink from that lethal cupidity; moral
stand-by is no substitute for 24-inch
reinforced concrete, for the blind certain
backlash. Yet how can we dream of
the hope to continue, how can the vectors
of digression not swing into that curve
bounding the translocal, and slip over, so
that the image of suffered love is
scaled off, shattered to a granulated pathos
like the dotted pigments of cygnus?

Ill
What more can be done. We walk
in beauty down the street, we tread
the dust of our wasted fields. The
photochemical dispatch is imminent, order-paper prepared. We
cannot support that total of displaced fear, we have already induced
moral mutation in the species. The
permeated spectra of hatred dominate
all the wavebands, algal to hominid.
Do not take this as metaphor; thinking to
finish off the last half-pint of milk,
look at the plants, the entire dark dream outside.

166

Nothing Like Examples
With its threatened yellow tag on the chain
we were ready again in the evening. Pallor from
the week was intense, as a flame in some
weir or wicker basket; marks on the brickwork
destroy pain. Its yield is so tight and graceful,
you see it passing under the lower shutters and
through the arch into the yard. Failure like
the frantic lark has no place by the lock.

Please invent the change to advance, gripping
the rail by the chapel door. Had you a sister I
could have thought longer and down the slope
where water ran out over the limestone sill.
The full moon flashes its Roman tinge and
prepares for new decimal butter. But none of
the smaller plants had been returned, it was
a betrayal of sorts in a rather uncertain mile.

She is racked by desires so foolish, such a
lombardy storm in the small park where the
children play with gravel. By the stream all
the glass is coarse and twisted and yet this is
more and more a peaceful universe. He will cut
off his thumb to please a select crowd but it
is a trick of course; death hovers because of
the dove's lamentation, his part of the soul.

Why don't you go down the street, why not
believe this? As a slip of praise to the glory
of an old building, its stones delicious in
metal foil. Then his spirits declined, he gave
his time to listless staring; the child sang
to his brother notable for black looks. Vacant
and possessed the hours stepped by in the
heat, the glutted alcove swarming with ants.

is still the fountain, giving him her
sweep of
hopeful grins: home like the bell & laid
in earth, in the shipwright's flower.

Ash surmounts the town on the hill.
The wharf has some glint in it, his
hands drip with syrup. Warm air flies

obelisk and such a delicate yarn also.

What he would say if he could. And why don't
you just drop it anyway, on some bridge where
envy curdles the strange visit. Chiffon ahoy is
beamed out to the dog. a yapping mongrel whose
plate in the Dutch tavern is thick with flies.
Love is all you need to start with, then the porcelain
stove will gobble up anything there is around,
including the lesser-used faggots of the brain.

And who would drown under the noetic shower,
not her sister, mimic benediction. But this is
more and more a peaceful universe, it turns on
this mossy pivot. Who docs not feel the new
petrel under his scapula, which is the tremor of
fortitude as it subsides. The question unasked
is too flushed and hazy for the bayonet in
the guard of honour, the water in the ground.

Es Ix.'bcder Konij*
(for Paul Celan, 1920-1970)

Fire and honey oozes from cracks in the earth;
the cloud cases up the Richter scale. Sky divides
as the flag once more becomes technical, the print
divides also: starlight becomes negative. If you
are bom to peaks in the wire, purple layers in the
glass format, re-enter the small house with
animals too delicate and cruel. Their throats fur
with human warmth, we too are numbered like
prints in the new snow.
It is not possible to
drink this again, the beloved enters the small house.
The house becomes technical, the pool has
copper sides, evaporating by the grassy slopes.
The avenues slant back through the trees; the
double music strokes my hand. Give back the
fringe to the sky now hot with its glare, turning
russet and madder, going over and over to
the landing-stage, where we are. We stand
just long enough to see you,
we hear your
fearful groan and choose not to think of it. We
deny the consequence but the outset surrounds us,
we are trustful because only thus is the flame's
abstract review the real poison, oh true the
fish dying in great flashes, the smell comes from
shrivelled hair on my wrist. That silly talk is
our recklessly long absence: the plum exudes its
fanatic resin and is at once forced in, pressed
down and by exotic motive this means the rest,
the respite, we have this long.
Only
the alder thrown over the cranial push, the
waged incompleteness, comes with the animals
and their watchful calm. The long-tailed bird
is total awareness, a forced lust, it is that

169

absolutely. Give us this love ol murder and
sacred boredom, you walk in the shade of
the technical house. Take it away and set up
the tabic ready for white honey, choking the
white cloth spread openly for the most worthless
accident. The whiteness is a patchwork of
revenge too, open the window and white fleecy
clouds sail over the azure;
it is true. Over and
over it is so, calm or vehement. You know
the plum is a nick of pain, is so and is also
certainly loved. Forbearance comes into the
stormy sky and the water is not quiet.

170

Thinking of You
Not going forward let alone returning upon itself, the old fat in the can.
The old fat rises to a reason and
seems because of its can, not going
forward but in its rank securely,
so as to be ready. Divinity rises to
no higher reason since going up alone
is returning itself to the can. You choose
if you like whether we stay in the rank
or go forward as alone we can, divinely
secured about the midriff. Older than
forward is the way we might go and
grow because we do, fat. In the can it
is the rancid power of the continuum.

A New Tax on the Counter-Iiarth
A dream in sepia and eau-de-nil ascends
from the ground as a great wish for calm. And
the wish is green in season, hazy like meadow-sweet,
downy & soft waving among the reeds, the
cabinet of Mr Heath. Precious vacancy pales in
this studious form, the stupid slow down & become
wise with inertia, and instantly the prospect of
money is solemnised to the great landscape.
It actually glows like a stream of evening sun.
value become coinage fixed in the grass crown.
The moral drive isn't
quick enough, the greasy rope-trick
has made payment an edge of rhetoric;
the conviction of merely being
right, that has
marched into the patter of balance.
And here
the dream prevails, announced by Lord Cromer
his warnings of crisis revert to hillside
and the market town: 'the great pyrotechnist
who did it all, red from head to foot"—inducing
disbelief stronger even than remedies. We become
who he is, the abandoned fishing, the asserted
instrument renewed as a cloud over the moor. What
he says is nothing, the hills and the trees, the
distant panorama washing the buried forest. Who
he is tells us that what he says need not be
true, in^the dream to comtj it will not happen.
The botanist & the collector of shells
0 & the consultors of dictionaries & those
w h o light fires with care now hereby
confirm the dream and the segmented wish made
solid in the time of day. It is cash so distraught
that the limbic mid-brain system has absorbed
its reflex massage. We move into sleep portioned
off in the restored liner, and the drowsy body
is closer to "nature", the counter-earth. The nervous
system burns hissing down to its fluid base,
watched by the hermaphrodite from Coventry.

t

172

Now freedom from care deflects the care itself; that
grandiloquent spiral of common-sense was
exotic after all, what
was said to he tme was so
because said urgently—and when imitated by
lazy charade the truth became optional, alternative to the grand stability of
dream: "the transit from drive organization
to cognitive process." The truth has lately been
Welsh & smoke-laden & endlessly local, and
"getting it right" held the nagging danger of
not getting it at all. And being right is not so
absolute as being so; the climax community
of the dream brings new eyes, the man in the street
is visible again. The distance of being so reopens
the millennial landscape, "that wc need not even
think of it as possible."
Then the possible seems
a paltry art: "the perceptual events of the dream
produce a partial or temporary reduction in the
state of need current in the organism." Whether
partial or temporary they release gratitude, the
moment of joy self-induced as desire turned back
into a globe itself infolding like a sun, or like
a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty.
"The spot was the one which
he loved best in all the world."
And such affection curdles the effort to be just,
the absolute perception spreads calm into the air
and the air works like a sea. The horizon is lit
jk with the tightness of wayward sentiment, cash
" as a principle of nature. And cheap at the price.

Of Sanguine Fire
Swift as a face rolled away like
pastry, turned up the stairwell oh
cough now room for two &
faced with bodily attachments:
evidence hovers like biotic soup, all
transposablc, all like. The pastry
face takes the name Pie (crust folded
like wings over the angelic substrate, all so like pasties they
hover again), is younger by a
specific aim. From upstairs the
face crosscd by banisters
counterclaims in re Outwash, it
foils downward, round the newel,
to a fierce vacancy guarded
on legal & moral grounds which
run to the limits of perfect zeal.

Outwash and Pie face across the
table, synergic coils wound through
the house of Mercury where they dwell;
in extent far out like angelic
protraction, fortitude, appetite—these
doorways face out to the dyke,
and in and out go Pie and Outwash.
They loop over the difference in age,
in the glimmer of evening, angry in turn
at the visceral lightness which fades
so swiftly outwards and upwards—is
this really mud & zeal, is this the
perfect earth? Custard in glacial helix,
face down to the scooped-out place?

175

The alluvium does not rise or lall; the
song is cquipolar and the faces are
conjoined in likeness, made of that angelic evidence. Disposition sports in
the stairwell. Pie speaks, it is a last
precultural eulogy: I'm buggered he
says if I care I
don't give a four
penny damn or
a blind fuck where
soever and now all the
mountain peaks sail by in handy likeness
and pride & passion & moral precept/gurgle
like the honey Outwash expected to
run busily with the milk. Pancreas strikes hard
into the valley floor. The adrenal cortex
cannot fail to grab for the willow wand.
life's like that all round. Pie is
chastened, grows more organs of a strictly
theoretic cast: wine runs in his head like
stellar juice (like evidence, off again):
the path runs out to
the lip of my fear, for
you; the planets bow
their heads at every door
At fortitude they sing in unison
At appetite they knead into a lump
At protraction they shine like the letter D
like you, like me
wearing the three
garments of the animal soul.

176

Let's face it says Outwash you're some
what gone in the head, an organ
contrived as a fancy at least, in the
stairwell, like the proleptic comfort
of taxis in Huston Station. Draw off
a sample of that spinal fluid,
take more care. Be trusty. Our true fate
is post-alpine, our true place bounded by
small mountain ringlets:
who have therefore no weight or load upon
their Faculties, nothing to dead or slacken
the Spring of their Nature, no Concupiscence
to darken their Understandings, or to pervert
their Wilts, no Indisposition, Languor or
Weariness occasioned through crazy and
sickly Vehicles
wait for it, Pie
conceives a whiff of apple, even short crust, wait for
it, like one bold face too many, pyloric mill
racing; yet Outwash runs on for the cloud—
but are always Fresh,
Vigorous and Bright, like the life and
quickness of the Morning, and rejoyce like
the Sun to run their Course—
and
makes it through zero gravity, he too on the
verge of deep narcosis. He slides his face
down three stairs, skipping the treads; he merely
thinks abruptly of a red sexy pudding.

And still the sensual race soaks up
the issue, evidence this time of unmannerly
lust. Pie cranes into a softened cutaneous
layer, name spread like gaudy lipstick.

177

Outwash bends under the lintel; beads of
angelic sweat hang like jewels over
the western hemisphere:
fierce vacancy lies
in the ground.
Eyes with love with
fortitude, flaring
to the idea brushed
past the cheek
erotic counterpass
in the thoracic cavity, the
slender likeness
of blood
between two
faces the slight
salt
of the stairs
bread
in the stairwell
love
as an intensely chaste brush with
the idea of heat, its warm likeness
melted down into
legal guardianship, of the
frail pinnace.

How preoccupied with the female zoning
of the house are Pie and Outwash.
The patient swelling of transposable parts,
like an incomplete theory of merely

178

physical decay. Gangrene in the evidential
footings, nothing to call she, yet
pervaded with female oestrus; hot under the
limits of "perfect zeal "? See
says Pie in chant the
wagtails, sedge warbler,
they fly just under
the curve of love, they
skim the face
of the water likeness
evading with the
quickness of
the morning the
bounded condition
of name.
Eyewash says Outwash and means
love for it, helpless in sardonic glimmer,
peering for the small window, the
"evidence". Steam rises off the water surface, minute shifting of levels.
Lipids drop to no purpose, like too much,
they allude to what could be
younger still. Planets stream across
the fields and in at the three doors.

10 UNCOLLECTED POEMS

The Friday Ballad
The cruel child is elevated this morning
by the prospect of careful memories. How he
turns warmly into the shade, how he would
like to lay open his left arm. It is wise
again to look into the summer garden, the
birds are so witty with the green moss.
The cruel child defers to the antique and
senses the third cuts hidden away. Juices
flow like a crest in the kitchen, now he
bends his foot over the kerb. There is
perfect order in his mind. Arch of Titus,
the book held together with sticky tape.
Why is he reluctant to come back. Who will
take a long sigh at the remand home,
guest of the chamber ensemble, set about
with patches of Field Southernwood. Deep
calm infects his chest, still his humour
is far beyond reward and normal endurance.
The cinnabar moth commences his song—a
sentimental ditty devoid of malice. The cruel
child hears the song and beats time on
his slender forearm. His eyes burn, but
not with envy: there is no chance so broad
that he cannot step quietly into the centre.
The clouds open and the cruel child is
taken up for protection. The weather spoils
him, too much sunlight. The price of zinc
remains constant. We on the banks of

V iz, it gets changed as each pivot is
laid out in the star winding—so far
as the lexical diaspora, the Arab
terms leaping, water not ready in
the well. No more than, the
leader hunts back, grey light, all
that was across Sinai. The stones
lie now in less morbid scatter,
touching in
phase across the relief that it is so
much withdrawn &
hardly settled, why
does the mole press
back to the surface
of old love. Each angled to its
point of flux & so on & with so
much its place removed, the
leakage in moral sense
to the "error
signal", making
the rainfall restless, unstable:
the loop not connected
but open & induced to nothing. Here
the guide falters. The cone heats
to a dull brightness. What is meant
makes its own small displacement, and so the tracks
fade off in their fictional extent. variable star gale, twin poles distribute all the reverse signal. Patience ascends from the
well; sheer hateful energy in the shortwave is
god-like: we trust all
that we hear. All the layers
induce silence, the air heats, old
love transforms the
control & water is
lost, blessed in the indifferent star viz it
gets changed.

Bite on the Crown
Human voices come past the table
lifting that pie
that we be there with envy abated
on the bridge at the far end of the garden.
Places rise for the furnace, all ideal
all press in
to the carnal soul; and so warmly
the wind mounts over to an entrance.
Clouds make the sound fitful to hear
and cramp sideways the light
we cover
the wounded eye as we are brought
to the cool inner room. No pain
crashes into the river, it is optic flame
I am burned by in the star-burst
of lint
and plaster. This hurt is lustful
for relief, spikenard revealed in
the small box
but touch shows
only the mirror, opens out the harm.

While & Smart
The point is marked by a dull red
circle as we go in and are sealed
by cloud. This is the first-born count
of the shore, glove on the wheel
like the white hawk he calls to, rising
to powder wished for and spilled
On his hand. Through the office and out
to the small yard the sound crosses
by life itself (all risks) to the wedge
marked blue on the dial. In the cloud
the bands show briefly the reasons for staying
at rest, trust threaded to passion
Which is brilliant. The shore-line spins to
dry versions of evening, as the air
throws bright specks on the screen ahead.
The ticket raid is certain: go to
the mirror boy and see the frost there,
wings numb & shaking on the frame.
We turn up to mark seven and wait.
The frontal tree drains like the smart
raven he calls to; he is beyond lines dyed
on the forearm and shoulder, as we
are also. The new light from the grain comes
to the throat and hovers there, by consent.

The glass sweats out and

the mountain path, it
is pasture for the moment.
No gain by night in
the passage of rowling

ploughs up thoughtful
acid lines, is cold.
Up the sloping path to
the kiosk, icy newsprint.
White butterflies in
the sun, dip too close to the
table and the glint
snaps them, dimorphic marble. We sit
round by the lower

They go off in ageless parity, into the fields
of marjoram burning under the hot sun. I
hope for this to the point of such
abstraction, it shades into the detached
retina itself. The wind spreads off too, the
threads run right into the hotel lounge.
How should wc not go on with it, the defied
omen the place where we warm our hands?
The question tilts to its answer, we watch
them file through the square, gait low-slung
& alert. And yet we do not need them: the
light reflected from the balcony on the
damp stones, the tide rushes by in darkness. And no word to the living, we are
blown over & suffused with nutrient salts,
cathodised & protected, the threads spin
like a candle. Now they decline in the
last coma, they are stones still damp: the
scent is exhausting. Smoke drifts over
the small tables. Pointed lightning darts
against the earth; & with eager merriment
the bees cling to the same white flowers.

The K i n g of Spain

Now with the mark taken away the voice,
like too much shade sideways in the air, cuts
back to itself. On the instep of her new shoes
love is the mark, spelled as "made in Korea":
have patience, be serene, fly down with the
silver nutmeg held on tight.
Out on the flight
deck the fuel canisters simmer with their
dream-liquid of the moorland throat: deuterium,
outrunning the fall, lies ahead. The air on
the stone finds felt there, some cheek to touch.
Nothing is certain now but the advent
of immense feelings such as these, as silver
and nutmeg arc exotic colonial toys from
the rapist's pocket, but by fusion, how his
voice gives them back. Aus der Welt
werden wir nichtfallen, not dashing a foot
you say, we are so much before and after
and thus are saved, are safe, are rife. The
subdued nondescript humming of the night sky.
And thus the good die first, and they
whose hearts are dry as summer dust
burn to the socket. The three points
of the absent mark compose, for us,
the dioptric of the shaded valley,
the ignition touched by the field of light.
For us is the mark we have erased, like
streams as to us and with us, toys of
the voice, the fast breeder in top gear,
floating down to the cup.
And could it seem
an act of courage—the toy ("made in
Hong K o n g ) calm & free as stone:
felt for feeling as the singer's trick.
He suppresses the very mark, the air
riding over its absence, and his fear is loved
intently. O so skilled is he, by the
loose waterfall; over the brow the shade
flows past him, to the stone at our feet.

nightly and by mute signs,
lips sutured together as to keep
the pearl from the discount. The
picklock shimmers. Limbs pass
through the maze. The monitor
locks on to a vale acted until
hit and lost in silt, tuning into
the peak signal the piper plays:
(a) The triangular sling ascends and
anomalous standing-waves compose
the trihedron of geodetic base vectors.
( b ) Half mute the torsion song mounts
under glass, against it the girl presses.
So by the linden tree he sweetly leans,

Under her brow the snowy wing-case

darkly the stain skips as a livery
of your pause like an apple pip,
the baltic loved one who sleeps.

Or as syrup in a cloud, down below in
the cup, you excuse each folded
cry of the finch's wit, this flush
scattered over our slant of the
day rocked in water, you say
this much. A waver of attention at
the surface, shews the arch there and
the purpose we really cut;
an ounce down by the water, which
in cross-fire from injustice too large
to hold he lets slither
from starryr fingers
noting the herbal jolt of cordite
and its echo: is this our screen, on some
street we hardly guessed could mark
an idea bred to idiocy by the clear
sight-lines ahead. You come in
by the same door, you carry
what cannot be left for its own
sweet shimmer of reason, its false blood;
the same tint I hear with the pulse it touches
and will not melt. Such shading
of the rose to its stock tips the bolt
from the sky, rising in its effect of what
motto we call peace talks. And yes the
quiet turn of your page is the day
tilting so, faded in the light.

Smooth Landing
There is a lie of the immortal
which we wait for up here,
up on the slab as on the nod
the vapours puff and disappear.

And in the long run to give blame
adds new spirit to water-colour,
in the famous heart-felt posies
which decorate the killer.

Have you had enough? Just say
justly that the hostage accuses
himself, as he boils his egg,
counting to where he loses

hope of a softened future life,
taking the rough with humour
as a cataract, no less,
whitens to peace with honour.

Tagschlucht:

The next moment, the waning light expired,
and with it the waning flames of the horned
altar, and the waning halo round the robed
man's b r o w ; w h i l e in the darkness w h i c h
ensued, the cosmopolitan kindly led the old
man away. Something further may follow of this
Masquerade.

halcyon cycle we were rested in ease
and respite from dismay: strip to
the noted bark, stop the child.
O say your word by the mortar, invite
the scorn due, fail. He made his pact
with the sentiment of resentment, he
acted sick and was instated for ever;
his hobby was amateur fear of.
And the bark grew and grew. Its estate
was rested and mighty, willow down
close to the wall. Blood then barred
from the brain, sun in the sky, what's
lost is the hour spoken by heart.

Rise as on the hill does, the crime
of the paviour

Esteem its fold the favour looked for

or not if not in, not stayed.
For rest comes at the parting flash,
not sooner, the alarm in
the passage makes no mark. The
digits on the plate add up to
nine also, the bees swarm. Sleep
through the morning, careworn
child, the bird flashes, the spark
plays with your hair. Overtly
the step lacks time, hath not th'advantage.
And if not safe, in time.

It is unsullied and,
despite this, the
assuaged birds soar,
as they must.

203

So the seeds are cut, loose and like
the bounce of the crystal
dark scouts
we walk blankly in the universe;
oil from the lamp we need for our
calloused ankles. The shades attend
our motions, we hear their thankful
hum.
Sometimes a tune by Robertino
Loretti protects us, when so as to
then for cut! Or snip your master
the prince of green devices
to stir
his felted palm, conjugate effort,
to arise and strut joyfully aside.

The astrology of hunger proposes
a starry bun. The dust of commerce
adds glamour by morning, the trustful
shepherd stops in his track. Arrest
is sprung up, hope holds it, wish
wears its diadem.
And now crowned with sleep who
may flinch from the eye of God
in the spiral organ of Corti.
Who does we reign our royal house
is roofed with fateful slates.
Wishing to love is the sign now
painted with darkness, as the rain
moistens the huddled sheep. The peahen
shouts with fate also and is accepted.
So lowly is the divine body, so
pale the even rib.

Dors the bolt in the street mark
the laundry of the future—he inquires
of the smiling attendant boy. The
turn is spread so thin, how can he
eat what there is, the plate is nailed
down; but a railway, he laughs, is
not open to casual debate. So we
fall to agreeing and pick at the bone
of blind yellow contentment. The
fine tweed comes free and bleached
from the fingers, we are slowly rehoused.

It is the rarest thing, the compounded blood
and light makes lustre swerve in the dream.
By the flux moment we meet and in
flight to its
thermal precinct, serve the
oil to his master. Why then in the heart
by happy smiles and joy on her face

three of the first from the awning;
later they sip honey, refreshed.

This one is high in
its hourly residue

the line, intact.

Aversion to that, in his jacket, as the
sun falls, informing water by flake
and mail. And bringeth to a kingdom:
brown and peaty by conjecture, exempt from the gentle mark, NTBR.
He ties his lace as he just can,
elated by counsel in the spring day.
What is true caresses and warms him,
dresses his touch. See the bird flit past
in Portugal, do not fail.

No resented banter takes
the breeze forward, the sky
in chance halo, cadentia

the pit the punter stands,
a flower for his sister and all

Little morsels of chalk in the ear
make heated mutter, invidious
root-like whelk. To salt the

A line of zero interval
fits between the pair of points and

of the water-meadows

prolonged intake of breath:

Ami there split, do you hear,
at the lumen, "as the light

Bitter root, blue crest. We cross
into the ship hardily; spacelike

we are invaded. At the apex

of the black jolt, dehiscent
florid eclat
on the Egyptian plover's label. Is it the same
wind, Morike, in the same sombre trees? Yes at
the fluttered filmy face, de
saturated by
spectral shift. The nervous one sings
in the mountains, hoar cycloid above
his brow, his feet numb, "the bugle
ringing through a vast pine w o o d
to keep us together." In this local
inertial frame the tropics rest, fallow
as the northlands, and as quiet.

alone he runs
tawny and dazzled. Gleams
from the flower in orion catch
at his sleeve. The call
is lost in echo,
the blood-murmur, his hope
strikes zero and is caught, as
by the shade, so slowly
from out of that bright hall he came.

The travellers come to the gate.
Here begins the world line of the sphere.
It is a familiar moment
O my child
keep peace with the elements, the folded bird.
Your hair in the pulse-wave goes
as the coast by night, recursive
intercept. The region inside the sphere
is shaded. Backflow makes
your face shine, blood subducted
at the doorway. This is
another flame, not ours, we
stray with the child
wet with dew.

213

What swims in the eye
is mortal dread, solar
flare. The ear spins
with sharp cries, there
is shear at the flowline.
Honour thy father,
anguish as the sign
deflects through water,
into port. The shell
crossing is sport,
they are childlike
and their limbs intact.

After feints the heart steadies,
pointwise invariant, by the drown'd
light of her fire. In the set course
we pass layer after layer, loving
what we still know. It is
an estranged passion, but true,
the daughter willed back by blue eyes,
unscathed, down the central
pain pathway. Timelike delirium
cools at this crossing, with your head
in my arms. The ship steadies
and the bird also; from frenzy
to darker fields we go.

W O U N D RESPONSE

(1974)

"Of particular interest in the present context are
the observations made on patients whose middle
ear had been opened in such a way that a cotton
electrode soaked in normal saline solution could be
placed near the cochlca. A total of 20 surgically
operated ears were studied. Eleven patients heard
pure tones w h o s e pitch c o r r e s p o n d e d to the
frequency of the sinusoidal voltage applied to the
electrode. . . . One patient reported gustatory
sensations."

Treatment in the Field
Through the window the sky clears
and in sedate attachment stands the order of battle,
quiet as a colour chart and bathed
by threads of hyaline and gold leaf.
The brietal perfusion makes a controlled
amazement and trustingly we walk there, speak
fluently on that same level of sound:
white murmur ferries the clauses to the true
centre of the sleep forum. The river
glints in harmony, by tribute from the darker
folds of that guttural landscape which
lie drawn up under our touch. Blue-green to yellow
in memory beyond the gold number: the
tones and sweetness confuse in saline.
We burn by that echo. It is called love like a wren hunt,
crimson ice, basal narcosis. By deep perjury
it is the descent of man. Above him
the dicots flourish their pattern of indefinite growth,
as under cloud now the silent ones "are loath to change
their way of life." The stress lines converge in finite resonance: is this the orchestral
momentum of the seed coat? Our trust selects
the ice cap of the General Staff, rod to
baton to radon seed (snowy hypomania)—thus he
jabs a hysteric wound, H,(L at top strength.
Yet in the tent of holy consternation there are shadows
for each column of fire; in the hedgerow the wren
flits cross-wise from branch to branch. Afferent
signal makes the cantilena of speech
as from the far round of the child-way.
We are bleached in sound as it burns by what
we desire; light darting
over and over, through a clear sky.

The Made (iivi n Hack
The price of famine on the inner side goes
down to the spark, with snow crystals
in the blood,
washing again. And the lane
clears, beaten by bmsh, you
take the toprail
and push hard, so
that it opens too
for shale and scree; the mat now in the hotel
foyer grained with ant love. He smiles with
shadow within like a case of mica grips:
there is rage in the lace he calls for and
gets, out, you go
down to the sparking
river bed, road spilled with oil
flag out
angered with the shadow driven up.
Too far
but the iris clouds over to the bank and
we are starving like the man who says right
form and means no less, the rain is

I struggle with cautery
holding tlu- hrooni in the

by the orthoelase.
And we are burned out with hunger reversed
again holding, being held
as the snow cruises
to the junctions of recall in the place to stay
to put your feet up and be calm
shielded by the mantle of fields
green
and spoken of, coming down.
The hotel lights up on the first floor
it gets
late, veined with inner
stair and counter-stair
it makes a war
with smoke on the wall:
the day is lost in greed. Oh rest your head.

Cool as a Mountain Stream
The apple cap sinks down to your faint hopes,
sprawled in the sun on the grassy hillside,
shirt over the soft
haemal arch. By this vane in the ground
the roots start to sicken,
snow normal to zulu time stuns soft news
of choice all over the earth.
You spin with erotic doubt, ah then,
hysteric tenderness, is this
the mount of our youth
or his body? He must
be eaten slowly, by autolysis of face
thus forced to riot, claimed
by soft hands in his shin: not a beast of virtue.
Water rots in the stem. The park is called in.
We will come now. We do
pump & burn with hormone of the forest,
soft hair mute against
what we say. So the shirt thickens with salt:
breathe against it and hear
what you are,
"vigorous and moderately upright",
that noise again, "soft juicy flesh";
pollen here is bright feeling, damp spores
stamped down in the Eckman spiral of stripped earth.
N o w a haploid cyclone of insect lust
throws the heart into spasm & hard rock,
whirling round in the shirt
where the wound smiles
like a well-stocked
three-star freezer. "Perfect
conservation"/slow rot in the fibrils, the sun
mounts in greed and its soft fingers.

Thanks for the Memory
An increase in the average quantity
of transmitter (or other activating substance
released from the VRS) arriving
at the postsynaptic side over an extended
period of time (minutes to days) should lead
to an augmentation in the number of receptor sites
and an expansion of the postsynaptic
receptor region, through conversion of receptor
monomers into receptor
polymers and perhaps some increase in
the synthesis of monomers. [None
of these ideas bears upon the
chemical basis for depolarization
induced by acquisition
of transmitter
by receptor.

Pigment Depot
So the tenant comes back under his arch
of blood, affirming its pulse; the air dips
sharply and we are cold in
wide-angle blankness,
by a bridge on the motorway not yet
open to traffic. Steel rods
strike a pressure chorus in the hostel
for the revenant already a victim,
who sees a small grey woman descend
down the steps to the sea. The first
yolk is defective. The force for existence
composes a colony of black spots.
Just under the line of surf the black
cursor makes the split total, the
atropine shelf of vision.
Who else can
surmount this, the tenant's glass
is empty and remote. Yet he ignites
with order as an
orange-yellow chimney.
He does not
command the freehold.
Suddenly we are overcome, to concede
the whole force of his body to rise,
to granulate and make a sugar anvil;
we search the downland, to bring him
safely to that point of rest. Lights
stream past the carotid bodies, as
the victim reclaims us and our dark patch.
We are driven through rain to blue and scarlet,
to the memory of grey shadow
on the fringe of salt.
This is a passion which throws over
the hostage to violent ocular convulsion.
And still we cannot do it,
aspiration
leaves us coughing with retinal noise.
We apply for rebate on the form provided,

There he goes
as the road thickens
twin lights merge
and spin with syrup,

makes the arch a template of blurred foresight.
The tenant conspires with that power & is quiet.

Of Movement Towards a Natural Place
See him recall the day by moral trace, a squint
to cross-fire shewing fear of hurt at top left; the
bruise is glossed by "nothing much" but drains
to deep excitement. His recall is false but the charge
is still there in neural space, pearly blue with a
touch of crimson. "By this I mean a distribution
of neurons . . . some topologically preserved transform",
upon his lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.
He sees his left wrist rise to tell him the time,
to set damage control at the same white rate.
What mean square error. Remorse is a pathology of
syntax, the expanded time-display depletes the

So the trace was moral but on both sides, as formerly

Only at the rim does the day tremble and shine.

THE PLANT TIME MANIFOLD TRANSCRIPTS

1st April / 972
Today's session of the London PTM Conference will be of
especial interest to readers as it was dominated by a paper on
" P a l a e o m n e m o n i c Resonances", d e l i v e r e d by P r o f e s s o r
Quondam Lichen from the Edinburgh Institute for Plant History.
Periodic oscillation as the basis for rhythmic behaviour patterns
in many plant systems has been the subject of intensive recent
invegitation (correction, investigation), and Professor Lichen
emphasised that confusion will occur if correction for epoch is
not applied. Sleep movements in the common bean seedling
(leaf folding) are in phase with diurnal light-dark rhythms and
are triggered by photoreaction; but the "in phase' is not exact
and the diurnal periodicity is not causative with respect to bean
sleep: "Beans which have been grown since germination in
constant white light do not show any leaf movement rhythm
until some change in the environment sets it in motion. All that
is required is a single 9-10-hour exposure to darkness. Once set
in motion, this rhythm will persist in constant light or darkness
for at least 6-8 days, with a period of about 28 hours" (Sweeney,
pp. 20-21). The timing mechanism for this behaviour cycle and
others like it is clearly intracellular, and it correlates with no
identifiable flux rhythms in the external environment.
Difficulties have arisen in interpreting these data as evidence of
harmonic oscillation, free-floating in an arbitrary time continuum
rather than aligned in a linear time manifold of determinate
epoch. Growth kinematics are discrete for individual systems but
these systems are genetically covariant in vectorial space-time.
Linearity in the time manifold is originally established as a special
function of genetic velocity, and it should be realised that the pregcnetic manifold is arbitrary with respect to the sign given to
time vectors. The solar period of planetary revolution is the most
decisive phase of oscillation in "our" galaxy, and yet plus or
minus in the time-line cannot be set without reference to a
transcelestial epoch. For we can trace the motion of any celestial
system through its natural origin t = 0 to negative values of t "and
there is nothing to prevent the system having existed at such
negative values" (Milne, ZS Ap., 1933, p 14).
The pre-genetic flux of space-time is thus possibilistic with
reference to plus values, allowing the operation of causality but
not entailment. The genetic epoch G(t) = 0 initiates a determined

234

cytochronology, because almost at once the swarm of positive
velocities branch by means of differential acceleration. Only
plant systems remain functional on the pre-organic event
horizon, that is, continuing to synthesise growth requirements
from the prc-gcnetic space manifold. "Higher" evolutionary
forms have developed factorial nutrition, i.e., "eating" (vicarious
pre-digestion). In the transport of plant nutrients the support
loop of the root system creates suction gradients from the
inorganic system having existed (negative values) through the
exponential increments post Ci(t) = 0 and into the positive finite
velocities of plant life. The increments are exponential in the
sense that in the middle growth period of an organism there is a
linear relationship between the logarithm of cell number as
plotted against time. Genetic velocity in these systems is thus
bipolar: "Earth forces the roots of plants downwards, while
internal fire or aether sends their stalks and branches shooting
up to heaven" (O'Brien, summarising Empedocles). Positive and
negative values are set in bipolar orientation: and this sets the
epoch for genetic moment: abundant, foliate.
Interference patterns are thus instantly produced across the
permeability barriers in the plant (the internal "event horizon").
As progressive differentiation takes place in the genotypes the
manifold feedback loops acquire characteristic species-linked
resonance periods or memory cycles. The mnemonic process is
not like lattice resonance in crystals, however, since positive
and negative values are structurally differentiated in relation to
the genetic epoch; and these structures, like the combination of
amino acid sequences into plant proteins, constitute the phase
map for any given species within which the period-functions
arc continuous with the epoch.
The conclusion to Professor Lichen's
somewhat leathery discourse is greeted
with polite, photosynthetic applause.
After a prolonged lunch (described by
a sardonic young blade as "a veritable
been feast") Dr Cypress and Professor
Lichen adjourn to a seminar with a
small g r o u p of c o - w o r k e r s . What
follows are edited transcripts from the
mRNA recordings made in vivo. Dr C.
speaks first.

235

Quondam, I think we can relax the formalities. I particularly
wanted to ask about root uptake of organic compounds in the,
er, higher plants. Do you see this as importantly discontinuous
with the pre-genetic manifold? I am thinking for example of the
absorption of D-amino acids into the cells of carrot tissue.
Well, Dr Cypress, I think I must first take issue with your
assumption about "higher" plants; though I say it myself there
are many quite lowly organisms which shew an advanced range
of cytokinetic procedures.
Oh indeed yes, Professor Lichen and perhaps the term was
unfortunate, I only meant to suggest
And that's exactly my point, Dr Cypress: "suggestion" is no part
of proper taxonomy. The metaphor of relative elevation in the
hierarchy of morphogenetic sophistication is all too crudely
suggestive. And though of course I respect your own scr-rrupulous objectivity there are all too many today who confuse
height above ground with innate developmental superiority.
My dear Quondam I must reassure you that no reflection of any
kind
Hoots mon, it's in the air like tetanus spores, some genera are
just too big for their boots. The Lichen clan arc viable well
above the tree line, and not much further from Port Angeles
than a pig can spit I've seen trees held up by their Lichen
canopies.

into a rosette on the desk in front of

incident was quickly glossed over but
it remains indicative of important
biometric tensions underlying this
London conference.

18th April 1972
An extremely suggestive contribution was given yesterday to
the London PTM Conference by Dr M. Gale, from the Norfolk
Field-Station of the Chronic Research Unit, on "Microtime
Gradients in Plant Cell-Structure". Touching lightly for support
on Process and Reality Dr Gale was somewhat sceptical about
cellular interface models in pre-Minkowski format, producing
reified layers and truly monastic concepts of membrane and
closure. Whereas boundary conditions function as systematic
phased convergences along hydrophobic wavefronts, buffer
gradients in the form of lipid bilayers intercalated by protein
meshwork. This functionally complex wavefront characteristically allowed highly specific enzyme transport, as well as
selective osmotic permeability, the lipid frontier exposing only
preselected binding sites on the protein molecule and thus
forming vectorial enzyme tubes. As has already been proposed,
"there is considerable interaction between membrane protein
and the hydrocarbon chains of lipids, and a large number of the
lipid head groups are directly exposed to the aqueous phase"
(Branton and Deamer, 1972, p. 23).
The basic wavefront or barrier/gradient isobar may in this
general way comprise a discontinuity in chemical or electrostatic space-time without of necessity offering a gross physical
structure. Protein transport functioned across one orthogonal

237

gradient and this transferase activity did not inhibit
simultaneous osmotic f u n c t i o n i n g back across the same
gradient, inducing no "congestion" in the lumens. Indeed the
electrogenic output of positive sodium or hydrogen ions seems
precisely to form the reverse gradient specific for the intake of
glucose, against an existing positive concentration (Lehningcr.
1971, pp. 204-5). Lipid bridges and c o n d u c t i v e vesicles
propose a spurious integrity for the membrane as a physical
construct rather than a f l u x density state maintained by
hydrolysis of ATP; Dr Gale was quite unconvinced by data
derived from dehydration or freezc-etch techniques.
In discussion this viewpoint evoked a sharp response from
Professor Lichen, who found the implied mass-energy equivalencies too insistent on high-energy covalent bonding, "as if it
were a grand platonic bog". Prof QL suggested acidly that Dr
Gale was too committed to the hydroseral reference frame, to
which Dr G ("please call me Myrtle") argued that she had tried
to make allowance for this. Projects at the CRU tended to work
with energy states as theoretic substrate function, oscillating
across mnemonic beenfronts: "the world is everything that is
been the case." Prof QL muttered some such phrase as "orgies
of mathematical licence" but added more amiably that he
himself had been a Sort of Projector in his younger Days. Dr G
flashed a sweet smile and went on to describe some informal
becnwork speculation. Time-averaged protein tubes comprise
the meshwork of willbeen functioning, held in semirigid array
by double reverse b a c k f l o w or "dream membrane". CRU
realtime process models emphasised these memory-dream bilayers and associated been gradients, as (for example):

thermal dream to the face of

will vary to the face that past dream
to

it that melt past dream past to (equimolar)
to

by will been dreamt of it future that

238

so that wc would expect a system designed for the conditions
of been formation to be somehow adapted to the load on
memory." Dr C alluded to secdback screening being done by a
CRII fieldworkcr in Siam, on bee semen and interplant time
dilation; "I cannot state for certain," she recalled, "whether he
was the first to sow beens."

1st July 1972 (pre-empt): 0 hrs 0 tnins 0 sees GMT & post hoc
"At present the Earth is losing about 3 thousandths of a
second per day" and of course Rindler says that "evidently each
photon in the static description of the model moves with
uniform speed towards a limiting particle and then stops dead"
(MNRAS. 1956, p. 675). North reports on some theoretical
limitations (Measure of the U., 419-20) but the Cambridgebased Bioparallax Research Station now has observational data
to confirm an important distinction between stopping and

stopping dead.
Close stemmatic monitoring of specimens of Impatiens
glandulifera was synchronized with the now just past onesecond time-stop to record variations in sleep movement.
Mammals are of course immune to these secular effects as all
monolinear organisms exhibit simple phasic arrest indistinguishable from steady continuance; but bilinear plant systems
could be expected to display refracted harmonics in the form of
head waves. The observed sequence of events was as follows:
23 hrs 59 mins 59 sees: photons move normally with usual
speed towards air-cell interfaces and
impact shews usual pattern of partscatter & part-absorption.
23 hrs 59 mins 60 sees:

anticipatory wave-front begins to
induce turbulence & buffering of
photons.

0 hrs 0 mins 0 sees:

photons shew fully developed conical wave-fronts. Differential velocities
induce major refractive turbulence
and planar shear. Head waves introvert and photons stop. I n t e r f a c e

so that hy the method of steepest
descent we can write for t = 0:
lim c(t) = oo (willheen).
OhrsOmin 1 sec:

new datum produces regression of
head waves and layer re-integration
Photon incidence stabilizes at new
signal level.

At each stage of this process the air-cell interfaces of the plants
under observation at BRS shewed normal organic function,
slowed at the point of maximum compression to levels which
c o m p r i s e stop in stem-system time but p r e s e r v e d in
endoplasmic "counter-current" by the phasic differential of root
system time. Thus overall systemic arrest did not occur:
adjusting for signal shift in observed data we may conclude that
stem-arrest merely caused the stem & leaf system to function

temporarily on root time.
Thus stop is not dead stop according to observation,
confirming results predicted by theory. Plant death is clearly a
more c o m p l e x event than in other life systems. In arrest
situations like that just described other organisms are maintained
by mnemonic capacitation, whereas plants can clearly switch to
another part of the chronoscopic wavefront. One unexplained
point so far is the massive production & release of auxins (timelapse transamination) during this dilation sequence.

Affine transform (17th July 1972)
W i l l b e e n function has always been most p o w e r f u l l y
implicated in bilinear time systems with differential enzyme
signal rates, and NGF/IAA have been speculatively identified as
basic cross-phase transmitter substances (usually crossed
exponentially, to produce incremental second-order functions of
the "growth" type).
Monophasic dilation in stem-system time has now confirmed
this model for plant process, as outlined by Dr Gale (Proc. PTM

240

< />/;/.. 1972) ami .IN specified lor auxin catalysis by Sheldrake
and Northcotc (New Phytol., 1968). Stationary wavefront
patterns of differentiation, however, or "static descriptions of
the model" are difficult to test experimentally; Sheldrake and
Northcotc met strong opposition to their proposal that "the
majority of the auxin in the plant may be produced as a,
consequence of cell breakdown" (p. 10). But evidence from the
time-dilation sequence shews that reverse turbulence in cell
frontier gradients catalyses growth in a directly comparable
way. Since stop in stem-system time was not dead stop (and
thus relativistically unobservable), autolysis must have been the
chief cross-phase process: a starkly isolated moment of total

willbeen, sine qua folium cle arbore non cadit.
Sheldrake has more recently described how 'auxin, acting as
a messenger of decomposition and decay, causes the surface
area available f o r a b s o r p t i o n to be increased in those
environments where nutrients are abundant" ( N e w Phytol.,
1971. p. 524; see also J. exp. Bo I., 1971, p. 738). Phase stop and
cell death thus function indistinguishably to cross-multiply
gradients by signal feedback, and a fully relativistic composition
of velocities must be invoked to set "stop" and "death" as partevents within the containing bilinear reference frame.

3rd May 7.972
The PTM symposium assembled for the last time this evening
in a finale of exceptional power & radiance, well beyond the
wit of your procumbent reporter. Such scenes of precycle and
vernal interbeen! The discussion was to have commenced with
a paper from the Black Cosmos (C. diversifolius atrosanguineus) and some deeply serrated fibrillation was rumoured to
have transpired; but there's no smoke without fire and the
inversion was set up by Grass, the pasturage team from some
area whose name didn't reach me. Or maybeen didn't set out in
that direction, I don't know about that anymore.
There was some unfinished business over lecanoric acid and
the free m-hydroxy depsides which had been shunted across
from the enzyme phase. Were we back to front in that sequence
folded over double? The G(t) = 0 epoch shewed ignition at the
chronometric cusp in the sequences front the Grass team, null

241

gradient tlii.s time baek. Negative vectors in genetic space flow
across to the flower: "Let us propose that at first the genetic
code was in some way read backwards from protein to nucleic
acid" (Jukes, 1966, p. 187). We truly did propose, or were we
sidestepped exponentially, again I can't clearly determine. What
the Grass team exhaled into the continuum was the aleph-zero
reversion or linear strike itself proposed by the Cosmos. Darting
and humming like bees we were confronted at first/last by the
erotic! Thus the flower of the intellect (did you say) returned in
full array upon itself, enfolding fire with fire through the tireless
vigour of Time. The bees w e r e an intense p r o v o c a t i o n ,
metonymic selves in syllabic f l o w ( - ) towards the bright mirror.
The proportion of Reason to Matter is not the same in all the
regions of the Universe, yet the colloid field had shielded us
from the free transfinite stream.
And now by the inference from amino acid substitutions we
saw the genetic sign reversed "at the rate of about one base-pair
change in 2 or 3 million years," and from there "the RNA itself
could have been transcribed backwards into DNA." Backwards
was the front of this inferential catalysis, renamed the aleph-zero
flower of the ordinal stream. It was a strange moment, and
powerful, as the body of the earth rested overtly beneath us:
recognition in the match of sense-rescript that the use of time is

Fate.
How we all arrived at this moment of willbeen inertia I can't
precisely predict. Or was it recall, the Grass team had the
thought well shaded in bifocal residue as here:

But this again was before the more sane label, the negative
flower of the Cosmos, itself after the recognition of polynucleotides streaming out from the epoch such as shyne in our
speech like the glorious stars in Firmament. Hie re is a set of loops
somewhere in this great & forcible floud like the aurora and in
this total purge of the horizon both ways I stop before I do.

What lie says they must do is

it might have been prudent too. This
furtive admission of degrees,
the trial of an F, hybrid, splits
our cold lunch into panic.

Next they climb to the top, to try
their new flag. Worse than ever

The outcome is negligible. We must be
quite direct; the meal ticket is not a coloured

Above the night sky the atrophy continues,
costing just what it says on the ticket:
the open question over and under and wasted
as childish carols, ripe well before time.

So to adopt the excursion of choice flavour
the star man empties his regard into
a replica of the faded hill. Some plug
of fancy holds the light slanting through
seraphic cloud, playing the safe bet.

And the meadows

Over the rosy hedges the passions
in their circuit feel for the safeedge of the hoop, their votive antiphon:
all goes in the old way,
leaching the soil, guessing when to cut.

262

Now the band narrows towards
its stand, the light uniform and clear;
calm presides in the lane as dust settles,
laying "a charm of love amongst men. "
Even at the sky mark, as a heroic measure,
the reason for this leaves no print. Yet
in stock the air corrodes his throat and
nails him twitching to the Earth.

THE L A N D OF SAINT MARTIN

"The sun does not rise upon our countrymen; our land is little
cheered by its beams; we are contented with that twilight,
which, among you, precedes the sun-rise, or follows the sun-set.
Moreover, a certain luminous country is seen, not far distant
from ours, and divided from it by a very considerable river."

Start
Spill the dish his lip said,
at the side, this one, stop
and run and stop then. Was
the day wet when he set
to it, for his cheek the step
on top. Wish to wish inside,
the slip led to this. Within
and done, a life of silt.

Next
In from the grain a neck shone,
a sandy shoe. Red or bad or wet
as needs be. H i e ache beyond
his other self, as you say he
will stay on for it. His rest
and arm will, too. Even the sky
is hard to see but leave, and see
and follow, and leave but see as well.

266

Reason
To be ill said his way to look
out. this may break what will
not mend. We know that. And
if not so it will not do, the life
is like as not. Under the roof is
over the floor; also true or lost.
I give my life for that, note well
how this is not enough.

Point
Ready yet was the best; this
day took a white strip by
the shelf, at the back. You must
not fall over, the top is marked
with a nib. Yes it is. The chance
goes bit by bit across the air
and is changed, or entire, as
yet the time flies utterly.

267

Fill
More thread settles in. But sink
for it counts by one, quick to
meet the door and pass him. Not
lame, not hurt, all that too far
true. So far, after the dear one.
Why you look to me if brought
here now, or soon, and then wait
for one to one going on by.

Only
It can be cold if you do, to
give way, open your eye.
The shelf is under what you
put there, the help is part
of the store. See it carried out
as we like no less. We are told
this. He gives a hand and falls
exactly, and before he must.

268

Cloth
leaf-leaf and sister speaks, we pick
any song up. Hat the last bit
you left over, you did. On the table
damage mounts. The tale starts
again and strikes. Any best week
is lost like that, we admit, life
long too much to stand. Too much
to find is so, this time round.

Send
No more your name seems right,
it slows down, it won't call, shading
the coat. Quite pale where you want
to give your word. Willing, without
end, at this point step off. Nothing
else showed at all. The same one
he tried to hold, up and down
and melt and then he did.

269

VERNAL ASPECTS

"All you must do on receipt is place outdoors in a cold position
so that the frost can work at it and break dormancy. 4-6 weeks
of this should be sufficient."

Exponent
Quickly white and slowly darker,
the path clears by the use it gets;
yet the sky is like wet wood again
and they shout for more than we'd
care to look at. Reflections make
cuts in the skin where the thin end
of a wedge keeps the door primed
like a step from a railway carriage.

Temper
When you squeeze the lid it clicks
and the beads jump. Oh yes, but do
be careful they don't fall out
like days quickly and soon it's timeto say that too, dark for light under.
And they cross as I told you, getting
ready to give up and to be given in.

272

Coil
It is a trick of the limit a day presses,
as lined with notice it scrapes by;
the next step still not ready, put back
any you don't use. Yes, alright
but the small one isn't right yet
and the night won't rest, too many hours
in shadow of thin vapour. Now
the carpet is not touched and across it
light settles like a bent spring, no
delay at all. Everything is here and is
being burned slowly and is enough.

Storage
Truly it is not a box but a top,
what goes out comes out and
the moon in fog gives more
than is yet taken. How could
a living soul eat his dinner
and not choke on the total, if
the hours too did not feed him up
as small fry back into the swim.
And so nothing was said but only
"'Mr Kania canya mend our clock"
and there were no pains in the lost
marks of that passage, only the marks
of its studious account.

273

Winding
Between two states run the waters
of the river no man steps into but
in which the smalls splash every day,
a civil order intently crossed.
No she says hoping to mean yes,
three red squares on the bottom & three
on the top. And don't you dare
move it, practice rage in the ground
of playing up by spilling over. No
hints will press me to care and so
1 care just correctly less.

Bolt
If you set your mind to it, the words
tell you the first levels are free ones,
only the end is fixed by its need
to be freely led up to. And for me
all levels are held but the last,
the parting shot I don't dream of
but see every day. Then you buy
another notebook, scissors vanish
and the spiral binding shews justly
the force of even intervals.

NEWS OF WARRING CLANS
(1977)

Consulto Speculo gcris Omnia; fallet Imago:
Tc nam (an jurares) sera Ruina manet.

At some moment in the clan's prehistory
there was panic that the high points would not
be completed on time. In the sense of "what
counts is strictly under age," emotional
negativism and fatuous serenity are states
like a loose rein on quite the wrong horse.
The clan, tres priraitif in variable kinship with
notes on anomaly, turned pig-style right down
on the shell. Outlook vaulted with crystal brows,
in fact they blanked out for inventions
about battle. The rents were needed from that idea
to revoke greed and invite swift cunning.
Ihus on the Pentecostal peneplain, at
high altitude with mist and star-play
swirling below, the ties of a juggled racket
dumbfounded the watcher's own care
by childish excess: boredom so rhapsodic,
and pure, and classically monographic
That a crow-lined tanker fluttered the tapes
in the chilly air. Alarm roused these woven
nests and the funds never ran out, the streams
dick & clack from the pump of days.
Add any distinct subversion but get your

Four dark lines on the lower check then
stubbed at the nose bridge, to wrap up
the blue star and make ready. You can always
see what you want if you play fancy and
know the wrinkles. Slender strips of some
apparently special grass seal up the blade scars
with mastic gum. We would file our teeth
into hooks if we dared, and when the first snow
is reached the leaders are peeled off, a pulp
elation revealed to its double.

to await "developments"—no screen can chart
the hostility of his desire.
He takes
a knife, rejects it
as too warm
takes another and makes
the initial cut. It is
an unknown birthday
in the high hills,
now air flows freely
and animal scents mount his attention.
Consider the stem

No one can wait as the herbage is scorched off
by the sun's total octave. In that agreement
the two count up to the first skirmish, ready
as stout troopers to take the floor. Many feel
stamp dourly or chafe the protocols, whilst
the graded raid is stencilled upon each rumoured jaw.
Oh where is the tribal influx, why the hell
isn't the light ready; if you're not the cash
you must be the food, yer dumb git.

278

The gradients for soul passage at every level
are cast down for each class, as per
shuttlecock in a fancy tram-car. All risks
are no risk. Option trading has become
the hottest game in town.
And does the option
wag the stock, with peace and gentle visitation?
They rivet the stick
close to strike, shorting the stock
against call;
in the tree glide the lie sits like gall by
what you say it does, messenger creature.
Far now into the white refuge this banquet
spreads over its days of hot rock. The wardens
conceive fear as a plan of relief and compute
the mise-eti-scene. They advance said forging
as the party sharpens, to refer uniquely in view.
The tribal actuary is already too derelict
to seem awake as he drives the hand packet
at a false grabber,
the water forays
see to that, and thus each slat of the 'cultural
horizon" is geared up according to form.
Axes are ground back and fluxed. The diodes
are tuned by costly milk splashing, or by spotwelded hints from all advanced outfits.
Crunch and whirr midst stunted
bushes, past the rib-cage of the
burned-out photo archive. Must
have the melt action, must have
the water ration, have to crimp
the incandescent Tab.
As the lintel slides into its pinions the wax
riot steps closer. Mist & smoke are hard to tell,
knitting for a pearly jumper. DTr scouts arise

279

in a line of chorus round the raft, too formal
for the song according to advice but gathering
fresh darkness: a rim of froth, carbon black,
seals it. Then some heaviest sound yet
from within the slice folding of all-natural
flavour hits a gross epact, and fate stands
fixed on the canteen floor.
For all around
the cool breeze murmurs, rustling through branches,
while from shivering leaves and broken lights
streams down deep sleep, lying where it falls.
This is the song & dance of a small minority;
restless at the planned loss of blood donors
they grind their even teeth in the moonlight.
And on the tab were little mosaic gaps aplenty,
with cool savours sweeping across cooler,
more vacant skies. Paper and mimic silk we say,
or honey & milk, the shades talk or lurk
in twilit conversation: the tribal shows
palter and fall right off. Even the discounted
losses are stippled in, on a brass hinge
folded back as the routes are scaled away
down many sandy defiles. The shrine is almost
a raft, of course, crazy at those rates ahead
and yet no rest, or too slick a total,
fires the engine by cubic and stepped rising.
The blood group orders new hardware,
with a flair for gearing its plan-.
to the time of the also-ran,
to a quick sally down a blind tube.
Cosmetic universals likewise choke
their line from the planet.
as a power cable in reverse or
right down the same drain.
And still to be dressed, still to be neat
is truth or riot in the street,

280

Moating like the oil u p o n

the chartered streams of Babylon.
And so, no more grab auctions at this altitude,
bidding on clip by descending half-tones
of shaken foil in the tree. Take what you get,
go anywhere, strictly come back nothing.
They brought up some tale about white fox
teeth, flighty talk with the lofty albino trim,
you know the kind. They burned out the flute
stops without even looking (so they said)
and keenly personal were the stares
that came with it. Lit with one match, right
up to scratch, that crew were over the line
before even the flag dropped.
Like the dapper
butcher painted in phosphorus, the town planner
prowled round his snap-shots of triumph.
A real lucky break. "All will reveal right out
to the flat truth" say the nasal rangers alongside.
On such orthopaedic skids the day slides
into its dusky slot; neither barren nor reckless
yet but on the ran. And the drive gets
to go straight by decision into falling rocks
again, any whole slur in the nap will do it.
The raid is fixed into the spoke and, yes,
chamfered by vocals at "sweeping spring choice",
roughing up the northline.
The plan
was to spread many lies, each quite gross
and polished to the gloss of air-line greetings.
Several coal and marble mines are already
reported to have been seized. The saturation
of what is "solid and durable" is cooled
to a sham-level of killing frost, pain is feared,

281

false danger triggers waste of fear. Since
in an outraged moral system the lying report,
subject to efficient causes, is bound fast
to a truth mostly formal, the efforts
at mendacious gab exceeded all limits. Good
taste was shunted into the slogan vestry and
reconstructed as billboard nostalgia: the purest
central dogma in the history of trash.
Again
'it has not escaped our notice" that, by
song & dance, men cannot live or move out
in the midst of plenty. We munch and munch
along planned parenthood, getting and spending
on the same credit card. False tedium
bids up each braggart by his plea bargain,
to set the motif as if vicious, viz., takes
the getting out of wanting, but in fact
the Kung out of Fu, the final arts are martial.
You don't always get
what you want, so
storage is less
of a cramp:
You don't always want
what you say, or
say what you
do (do you):
Bashing the cloud cuckoos,
short of street sugar,
what we need
is hot milk:
The rest is allegory linking reserve error,
we make a roux to thicken up the money supply
and merely imitate attention. You stamp about
looking for more cheap cuts and square deals.
But soup levels kept them all without sleep,
greasing their eyes with mimic fire. The clan

282

rehearsed unison by cypher, to mark out
the list of victims in death of their own.
They fell down and bled in droves, they sang
little glees of passage with paper & comb,
the recorders ran out of tape. The tedium
of all this struck a new high in feedback
whine; that tunnel was jammed with insults inside and bardic butter overall.
The first scout said he meant what he said,
once again meaning only the hesitation
with which his fizzing tracer sprays
peppered the dewy mountain air. Very early on
for that practice-work: for every clone on the step
above the nature of hot food, some other variant
is watching from a step further into the menu.
At what point does printed cash reconvert
into a single verisimilitude, or does it pay
to count on paying. Write when you get work.
The cheese was fleeced
in a gray crush, old & mouldy
as a gorge of brushed silk;
() death in life and pickled cabbage
the seams of salt arch like a fat tabby
on the dresser scraped with a vengeance;

After lunch the yoghurt left over flips back
to fiscal by-play, sagging as current debts do.
Suck or lose this matrix. The route signs
are quite subtle, just planetary appetisers

283

and the main party watches the sand
which is all quiet like a fried egg.
And hy
this narrowest pinch in the paid-up history
of our attentions the fear of surprise became
so intense it blew the fuse and satisfied
the hopes of almost the whole band. Well
settled back in their prefigurement, the kidnap of parental vantage, these sleepy children
chose not to wake up: their choice succeeded.
The option prevailed over theft precisely
by means of ambush, and employed the same
rigid tracking.
The pause displayed as
its credentials shewed only the chagrin of
a recognised falsity cut like a rock wafer.
"Too late" came in before "not enough" and
the long-term end before the snack
in the long-stay dancing school. The mode
d'emploi proved a perfect dream, all completely rewired, you must believe this
sincere account of the negotiations. Thus
all the scouts confirmed a night raid by
the canyon route as the very best chance,
requiring a legendary daring in scale with
talents in the vault. The staining rites
were doubled at this; and the pause plus
its option flanks, could this be less real
than the ardour we wanted more, that
what turned up was just the ticket?
Track star, lead over
the fields of snow,
now's the time to
keep in lane, where
the angels go.
Put a pretty stone in
the ancient well

as night, our friend
in need, darkens

This is the aee
of all desire,

and flame of this
exhausted fire.
Down in the rocky defile stark crowding
shadows held still, also "anyway" since
the any points here to "this one only" or
"in thy will is our mortgage." The most
audacious lies pack the throat with steam,
we mean the full irony of fear and then cancel
all but the head banner (the instruction
to "be frightened"). Bold as top brass
the melody lingers in the blood bank, the
clan is caught napping and swapping
the false yaps of their dogs.
I le is in accord
with his uncle in the same tone-row;
the possessed lady
denounces cuts with jabs about standing
shoulder to shoulder
with the rock-like boulders of
the zen tea-room;
patience, hard thing, the very worst is yet
to splash your feet and get your g A e r s wet.
None of those colours is halfway near a good
match in a dying art, awake on the causeway
from base to crown. The loyal rebels
foresee through air interdiction that
their salt tablets will fade away, and the patches
of lustre make transit markers ahead
like the mirrors of ice they truly are.
All

285

the reports, in echo of stylish lies, lay
stunned hy drab hints from the sandy empires
of the plain. The old melisma in the frame
set by a new battle jittered like spring-water,
a painted stone in a painted picnic. Nerve
and verve broke for lunch & were gone.

4 UNCOLLECTED POEMS

Stay Where You Are
At the end point rain comes on
by the rival pyramid, the first
anvil of entry: we seem
so intently noted
in the rest camp you pay to leave,
long to fly over. A splash is made good
again or in the blender, ascending
from chip by chip to the calamine.
Imperfect joy simmers in the nub
of this razor, our care
for the good green things
we take and eat, hollow & overspilled

At the sylvan depot the treaty is still unmarked
not even summarised, motion is the inner portrait
of habit. True in every painless line,
alive in the death of its origin, the painted
nesting-box mimics a cardiac stop
but little pans
of blue & russet, from the very sauce-boat
of Horus itself,
the rack of spices in the clinic kitchen
point the future for brown eggs, and
clinch that deal for ever.

its glossy, villous choice. Both stripes

I looked at this muff, tears came
to my eyes and I sniffed, the criss-cross
was a midwinter apology with a surprise step at arm's length or to it.
He went Thackeray, I went Thales,
no one saw our acted parting shots.
I watered the track, he blazed the entrails
and the comb was set fair. For what
disquiet could this be remedial, we cajole
no answer now from her snowy tongue.
Silence is infective and fused; for those whose
chief difficulty is that of getting o f f
for a second round, radial-ply hot lips
break what they newly suspend, that.
In Austria they know what they know.
Here it is different, in the mountains,
where we bid for flour and accept second
best, still buying bread in sausage
and newly vice versa or, light in feeling,
there is no substitute for this.

Then part of it fell down.
It was like rain, down was its fall
but partial and to the side.
The side-part fell, if down
then sideways and lay
dying there too, on my side.
Thus parted, own you like it
as eye-pain. You laid it down,
her name your art dies for.
Beside herself you all part then
and her own is not so, known
down there as ways fallen apart.

DOWN WHERE CHANGED
(1979)

Anyone who takes up this book will, we expect, have done so
because at the back of the mind he has a half formed belief that
there is something in it.
C. Thorpe, Practical Crystal-Gazing (1916)

There was no qualm /
on that loot way
after the night exposure
and yet love-cramp
washed the tarmac
while harsh streams of air
too soft to burn right
buttered the throat
we grind the gyrus
with no choice but one
and the other turning
voice is the same.

The rail is interfered with
it is cut up already
libel on the road ahead
telling you makes, really
no odds at all. That bend
is too bad, magnanimous
like a hot-air balloon
over the stupendous balkans
or privately dabbing your linger
you do, that rail s done
as a praline, softly
in the airy open
there's no more to it
so out of true
the rail is sundered
I'm telling you.

296

Thanks to the lurid airways
an extinction event snapped
on the phrase blur, barely
as a nine-jewel wreckage
is linked to its Kristallnacht
or maybe shut yer face
you're sent on station and
corrupted with excellence
neither thinks to check
that's it. Their follies areas now, your pride's excuse
to ration fuel; or both.

Give yourself exit pallor
those duties too are
born to amuse and choke
like paint stripper. Here
the machine bleats within
its heated undercoat
where you are dry and
don't think to flicker
as with intimation or
traffic emerging from the right
it's too late, worn thin
these few scenes of note.

297

Already you get torn jfp
too quiet on the Hat
shut down and frontal
where water burns like wax
and is paid by turn
in the drusy eye
of storm perpetual
this darkened flame will
melt the byelaw, you say.

As through its lentil abscess
sun tempers the fad in leaf-fall
by stunned silica the pass
is concessionary until soldered
across the output, you see
what it takes; if at all
the palace of fun goes under
our cheap ride will blench
as a sunned Everyman spine
and Beryl's lenten favours
will cool to flinch or stay
put through a taxing day.

298

(»o ahead to the plant rally
down at heel in the bread strike

and will underflow to zero
to take back the land
ripped open like a flood
of star cancer and muddy roots
or too grandly al dente you feel

a success, far and awaybloated over the sand.

The creamy recruit pines
for his stone, down under
the second-best hiding
white at the foot of green

offers the perfect match

299

Even through the north' window
and on page 45 also
the dispatch is prohibitive
or in an upstairs room
watching livid reminders
it is the same. Cutting
a dash on warm days
you liken this to that
and nearly run out
and then you score
and you tear
and then you fold up.

The sick man polishes his shoes
wide-awake in the half light
what else should he do
as scent from the almond tree
abjures the spirit' with its air
of mortification. What is known
is the almanack set out
on a trellis, a pious gloss
over waste so clean and natural
that clothes out on a line
dwindle and then
new colours are there again.

293

All the hedges are paid for
hut as soap clears on the mirror
the willing helper is there
as herald of lazy, dishonest misery
in the pink fading surround
of clouds across a sky
if it were the final demand
we should shine with fear
but it is not.

A limit spark under water
makes you see briefly
how patience is wasted
that deep sadness is a perk
of the iron will; no sound
catches the binding dark
side of this relish, head-on
in thermite lock. Each onebound to wait, the other
blunders to see it and suffer
the play at choking
or not turning away.

To be at home is no quicker
than far off as a log
the hate blot is steady.

294

(>r, whe n a lark
while over the sea
blindly following
its instinct to ascend
into the air, and
to fall again
descends to
the sea, and
is drowned.

By the pure fluke
of the introit now
into the NHS cathedral
the bundle of new
roses in their Trauersaft
hits peak fluid
and shatters softly
like a blue vase; so
the new heartland
technology gives leverage
over the whole system
it sounds like food
it comes apace
it comes amiss
it comes too late.

295

You'll ge l ii given soon
lit better by skilled labour
to drop greed with a brittle chip
the smoke on the tarmac
is taken and broken in the draft
and spills with sweet clatter
as chalk hurts the eyelid
never stop for brow-ache
or wait to lick the spoon.

If the day glow is mean
and spoiled by recognition
as a battery hen, you must know
how the voice sways out of time
into double image, neither one true
a way not seen and not unseen
within its bent retort
we feed on flattery of the absent
its epic fear of indifference
all over again and then
that's it, the whole procession
reshuffles into line.

my early morning start

one bites one's lip right through.

You have to work it out
the passion-scribble

305

Just a twitch of doubt \v»- sail with
puffed about by the mall chance

through that rule of thumb or plain
work to rule to nail your way

keep cool and take your time.

Fresh cut in the green pound

A single black and then a bit off

or a doped crystal, sunk.

Famously fill, the mark of top reason
slips to a hen level or blunt lie. Don't
call it more than the excuse of fluid
which is its nature in a cloud bank
saying get ready, keep your nerve: the pin
is Egypt and sticks but the entire
boil-up in possession runs over
a second-hand illness on the face
greedy for endemic, chronic repute.

Pilgrim, pilgrim stop your plight
the watch is busted all over
like the snivelled rag you'd run

This time the relics turn out in force
of course they run to extremes
they are trained on black ice
on the grim or grand shelving where
the new floaters lounge. They come
like arrivals to the palisades
and activate surveillance machines
as a sliced loaf screened blandly
by the last bite of a trim bun.

309

Yes it is quite funny
to drink our till
so that it burns the throat
the catch is apologetic
as fun slakes the will

THE OVAL WINDOW
(1983)

BEFORE is a relation, of degree two, but it is
a relation for which not all the underlying
domains are simple. AFTER is a semantically
equivalent relation of degree three, with the
property that all its domains are simple—in
other words, AFTER is normalized.

This condition says
essentially that,
given the present,
the past and future
are independent
of each other.

The shut inch lively as pin grafting
leads back to the gift shop, at a loss
for two-ply particles
set callow,
set bland and clean, wailing as when
to wait is block for scatter. Ah so,
the estrangement of the cause brings off
a surcease of the affect, even end-up
battered in sawdust. You cut your chin
on all this, like club members on the dot
by a winter blaze.
What can't be helped
is the vantage, private and inert; yet
in a twinkling mind you, to pick up
elastic replacements on the bench code.

312

Formerly in a proper lonie, the rain
would pelt and cure hy the foam inlet.
Smartly clad they could only panic
through the medium itself, rabbit by proxy.
On both sides smart guidance ex stock
makes for home like a cup cake over.
Don't stare:
Police aware:
it is a defect coma, and it shows;
try it on, see if they'd want to care.

313

Just a treat soil Heine you noticc
thc base going down, try to whistle
with a tooth broken. Safe in our hands
won't cut up rough, at all, pent up
and boil over. Fly my brother, he watches
at point of entry, only seeming to
have a heart for it. Thermal patchwork
will tell, sisal entreaty creams out.

314

Coming through with your hack turned
you'd never credit the trick aperture
in part supply. Being asked to cut
into the bone matches wishing to become
the one that asks and is sharply hurt.
To be controlled as a matter of urgency:
don't turn, it's plasma leaking
a tune on Monday
a renewed drive
not doing enough
to reduce the skin on a grape; the whole
falling short is wounded vantage in
talk of the town.

315

Low in these windows you let forth
a lifelong transfusion, as by the selfsame
hand that made these wi>unds.
Keep back from the upper notch, rudning below
a steep flurry of pollen like a pestilence
rated up for coverage.
The two main shadows over the future tenseare pity and the lack of it, win or lose:
banking on form, the bright lozenge marks
rape swathing under a bandaged sleeve.
Stacking the calls as they come in to land
a perdita d'occhio the drill rigs
make a ring of fire, welded on.

316

Somewhere else in the market it 's called
a downward sell-out, to get there first
and cut open a fire break. Less won't do,
more isn t on either. How a gang of boys
set her face alight with a flaming aerosol can,
"her mouth was sealed up by the burns."
Attention is low in historic terms and will
drift down, seeming to falter slowly and
making excuses for the money numbers ahead.

317

It is deep cold, high cloud on the grill
to hear the swish of a month overheat
in snow on the hush, bird in the handi
The notice is not lit hy cycle time, /
blinded to limit the revenant by overt
loss of balance. "He takes pity with him
and makes it possible for him to enter the sea"
with the reflex of naked armour, unplayed
under the lintel.
The vantage stops off
in arc-light at frosted glass, yet all is shaded
and clumsily mobile. Lately poor eyes.

318

What if the outlook is likely to cut short
by an inspired fear in the bond market.
The place itself is a birthday prank:
current past the front,

en premiere ligne
like stone dust on strips of brighter green.
Given to allergic twitching, the frame
compounds for invertible counterpoint
and waits to see. A view is a window
on the real data, not a separate copy
of that data, or a lower surplus in oil
and erratic items such as precious stones,
aircraft and the corpses of men, tigers
fish and pythons, "all in a confused tangle."
Changes to the real data
are visible through the view; and operations
against the view are converted, through
a kind of unofficial window on Treasury policy,
into operations on the real data.
To this world given over, now safely,
work makes free logic joined to the afterlife.

319

So ihey burned their boats, looking on
as the frontage went up and loot lights
blinked in the watercourse. From eac h
throat at its fan opening they spoke out
their force of numbers. Either a point
object or its image point is said
to be real when the light propagates
through it by ash bluff to printed charcoal.
Count back the poll capture, fun running
like paint from blue to blue over
in the funnel head (sad despair, &c).

320

Sideways in the mirror and too slow
to take lip, it is the- point of death. Not
lost from the track as passing its peak
but the cycle burns out on the axle,
quenching a thirst with lip salve slicked
on the ridge of its porridge bowl. Still
spoilt by bad temper the screen relives
a guessed anxiety: wounds were his feast,
his life to life a prey.
The internal view
assumes an infinite linear address space,
a table on which are laid out all
the rival manuals of self-sufficiency.
Spring up, O well; sing unto it: but
the answer is a pool of values in prime
hock to a pump and its trade-offs.
That's putting it mildly, by repute.

321

Do he serious they say, .ill the time
in the world mounts .1 dcflcit
of choice moments fluffed and spilled.
Is misery worse than not knowing its cause,
the wrong fuel in a spirit lamp? The case
rests on tarmac already crumbled
in a pre-recorded dawn chorus:
when the furniture was removed
he pulled out the window frames, threw down
the roof, and pushed in the walls. Yet shortwinded the pay-bed recycles a bad debt
as if nothing else counted, as if there are
two distinct and mutually exclusive actions
depending on one test. Viz, oilseed
is a fashion laid out like data, the view
loops round from the test drill sponsor
like a bird on the wing. Think now
or pay now and think later, the levels
of control nesting presume a reason
to cut back only and keep mum.

322

So w h a t you do is enslaved non-stop
to perdition of sense by leakage

into the cycle: one man's meat
better late than never. Motor life says
the branch office, a picture is not a window.
In a recursive procedure, the method
of solution is defined in terms of itself; as,
within the chain-guard, cold is the meaning
of heat notably absent. The arctic tern
stays put wakefully, each following suit
by check according to rote; it's precious little,
only smoke damage where that came from.

323

As what next if you can't, silent lire
dumped in a skip and sun boiling over
the sack race. Best before too late, with
loath to depart in the buff envelope torn across.
I'm finger-perfect by the yard, not like
the ancient sponges putting in question
another glad hand from the puppet dictator.
From the skip there is honey and bent metal,
romantic on trade plates: PUT SKIP EDI T.
PUT SKIP DATA, the control flow structure
demands a check that subscripts do not exceed
array dimensions. That is the regimen,
the bin liner of the second subject, holding
our tongues like brevet clients on call.

324

Within the frame the match play is staggered,
to protect the list f r o m its first mistake.
Skip and slip are the antinomian free gifts

mounted on angle-iron reflexes, as sick pay
predates a check to recovery. You're flat out?
But the method sorts downward, wired up
from the NCR cashpoint; you must choose the order
of choice, on the nail from which shadows hang.
What else null else just else if before
out into the garden with overshoot, the
moon is bright as snowy day. In broad
strip neon it ranks as a perfect crime.

At the onset o f l h e single life
it is joined commonly to what
is unlasted, lettered out
along the oval window's rim.
And casting the eave forward, in
the first delivery you do know
this talc in breath,
marking the helm wind as it cools.
It fans the rim on the inside
of the purlin itself, the tenon gives back
exactly your life task
and for the trained level. Grind up
to the hatchment there, they are later
as to the perfect clank. No time
first-round, first leg, with
dearer love he too could only panic
through the medium. Hold your chin
to the relief coach; I am a woodland fellow,
sirloin parted formerly
that always loved a great fire.
The window glints now in the lee wave,
fed with light up-ended. Crape put out
on the hives. Life cover
streams under, the master I speak of
ever keeps a good fire. Give a low
whistle, such country cannot be burnt;
fit the rebate, but
sure, he is the prince of the world.
We will cast on the half then and find out
the neural crest below, an inquest
wrought with frost without
snow-marking on the run to try

328

the spoil .tiul waste in a white suit.
Speak truly along the lip there, let
his nobility remain in's
court. I am for the house again
and the egg-timer, give the sweet air
back as nipped by the bud of ruin:
three to one herring.
Arms in sisal with the narrow gate
over-arched, knocking at the septum,
which I take to be too little for pomp
to enter a pleasant fee,
their faces are part-eaten. This is the place
where, deaf to meaning, the life stands
out in extra blue. Some that humble
themselves at the songbook
may turn the page enchanted; but
the many will be too chill below
in profile, and tender-limbed
in the foil wrap.
They'll be for the flow'ry way and draw
a sharp breath by flutter action, do it
quickly, tongue tied. That leads
to the broad gate
and the great fire, and deaf to the face
soundlessly matched to the summit.
We go over. The dip stands down
in the oval window, in
the blackened gutter stop of the newly born.

329

As I hey parted, she heard his horse try out,
hy the rustic lodge in a flurry of snow.
A child's joy, a toy with a snowstorm,
flakes settling in white prisms, to slide
to a stop. The flask is without frame,
metaldehyde safe in cold store. There
is a snow-down on that sand hillock,
the stars are snowing, do you see it there:
bright moonlight whitens the pear blossom.
You listen out by the oval window, as
calm waves flow onward to the horizon.

330

Her wrisls shine white like the frosted snow;
they call each other to the south stream.
The oval window is closed in life,
hy the foot-piece of the stapes. Chill shadows
fall from the topmost eaves, clear waters
run beside the blossoming peach. Inside
this window is the perilymph of the vestibule.
Now O now I needs must part,
parting though 1 absent mourne.
It is a child's toy, shaken back in
myopic eddies by the slanting bridge:
toxic; dangerous fire risk; bright moonlight
floods the steps like a cascade of water.

331

Snow-blinded, we bold our bre.ilh;
the echo trembles lik<- .1 pinpoint, on
each line of the hooded screen. It is life
at the rim of itself, in face of the brow
closed to sorrow. A pale white light
from the east is shining in the window,
a flowering spray in the glow of the mirror.
The internal view burns at this frame,
eyes frozen by calm. For full paralysis
of accommodation, three or four drops
should be instilled every fifteen minutes
for one or two hours. For the rest of
your life. Sight wherein my joys do lie
on a pillow white with shade, brushed
in azure along the folding screen;
all day long, the red door is closed.

332

So: from now on loo, or soon lost,
the voice you hear is your own
revoked, on a relative cyclical downturn
imaged in latent narrow-angle glaucoma.
Yet the snow picks up and infolds,
a mist of gold leaf lightly shimmers
as floating clouds go back to the mountains.
It is not quite a cabin, but (in local speech)
a shield, in the elbow of upland water,
the sod roof almost gone but just under
its scar a rough opening: it is, in first
sight, the oval window. Last light foams
at this crest. The air lock goes cold
in hot sun, blue streak under
lines swarming there, dung on all fours.
The blur spot on both sides gives out
a low, intense hum, sharp-folded as
if to a feral rafter;
the field is determined
by the exit window, the lens rim or stop
which, imaged into image space, subtends
the smallest angle at the centre.
So small
here that the pin is bonelike and watched
with the backflood at steep echo,
in brown water clamped at vantage.
Mountains reach across the folds of the screen;
green sedges line the path below cold mist
yet the stone step is boiling fast.
Upon that dropping floor
when hope is gone, the sky
spoken like a roc's egg
in cascaded magnification, runs in
and out and over: honey in snow.

333

The clouds arc while in a pale autumn sky.
Looking al the misty paths I see this stooping
figure seeming to falter, in a thick compound
of adjustments, sublimed in white flakes. Then
it clears down, she turns or round her
the sweet breath goes about, at midnight
murmuring. Extremities flexed and cold.
A light wind crosses the fragrant waters;
deaf to reason I cup my hands, to
dew-drenched apricot flowers and their
livid tranquillity. It has the merit
of being seen to hurt, in her dream,
and then much further on, it does.

334

Drawn to the window and beyond it.
by the heartfelt screen of a machine
tenderly lit sideways, the wish to enter
the sea itself leaves snow dark as sand.
Pear blossoms drift through this garden,
across the watcher's vantage clouded
by smoke from inside the hut. Tunnel
vision as she watches for his return,
face and flower shining each upon the other.
So these did turn, return, advance,
drawn back by doubt, put on by love.
Sort and merge, there is burning along
this frame; and now before you see
you must, we need its name.

Ii is a CNS depressant Endless sorrow
rises from the misty waves, like a wiek
in the light of conscience. Not feudal
nor slave-owning but the asiatic mode
as locally communal within a despotic state:
the slant of imperium coming sideways
"through the competitive examination (chinshih) on Confucian literature." Either contract
or fancy, each framing the other, closed
in life. A flickering lamp burns dimly
at the window, ready for snuff brilliance
which lights the mirror and shades the door.

336

Now the willows on the river .ire hazy like mist
and the end is hazy like the meaning
which bridges its frozen hanks. In the field
of view a prismatic blur adds on
rainbow skirts to the outer leaves.
They appropriated not the primary
conditions of labour but their results;
the waters of spring cross under
the bridge, willow branches dip.
The denial of feudalism in China
always leads to political errors, of an
essentially Trotskyist order:
Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.
The red candle flame shakes.

337

Iii darkness by day wc must press on,
giddy at (lie lilt ol a negative crystal.
The toy is childish, almost below speech
lip-read by swaying lamps. It is not
so hard to know as it is to do:
wresting the screen before the eyelet lost
to speech tune you blame the victim.
Pity me! These petals, crimson and pink,
are cheque stubs, spilling chalk in a mist
of soft azure. At the last we want
unit costs plus VAT, patient grading:
made to order, made to care, poised
at the nub of avid sugar soap.

338

Standing hy tlu- window I heard il,

exhausted with passion and joy. Free
to leave at either side, at the fold line

BANDS AROUND THE THROAT
(1987)

Fool's Hracclct
In the day park shared by advancement
the waiting clients make room, for another
rising bunch of lifetime disposals. It is
the next round in the sing-song by treble touches,
a high start not detained by the option
of a dream to pass right on through
the spirit proof coming off the top. What
don't you want, is there no true end
to grief at joy. casting away deterrent hope
in a spate of root filling? The upside of the song
from the valley below excites lock-tremors
as the crest gets the voice right by proxy,
non-stick like a teflon throat. To press on
without fear of explanation, refusing the jab:

Ah Curly do your day is done, The course
of woe is quickly run. Low without loss
your shining heart Has nothing but the better
part. The star of swords is put upon
his neck. He falls to the ground. Why not?
It is a root and branch arrangement, giving
the keys openly to a provident reversal,
to net uptake. To these Whom we resist.
To blot out a shabby record by a daze
intrinsic in transit: See what is won,

We have cut him down, Like the evening sun
His only crown. Don't you think that's enough
to peel a larynx at a flotation, they say,
by the stub of a tuning fork delivery. The issue
hits all-time peaks in no time at all,
buy on the rumour, sell on the fact. Only
a part gives access to the rest, you get
in at the floor too: And his dance is gone.

No Sonj» No Supper
Even so by open outcry across
this ring a deep frost cuts up
a halo of grey cinders; the night
is stark cold to pay less and less
And strike the hand numb with its
spoiling glove, the eye sex-linked
to give over by parity of first reason
in the Rotunda's even light.
For here is the display now, of inert
promise like a flick-knife in milk
dipping and turning to catch the offer
subscribed with cloudbands, upon
A gilded defacement. To pay less and less
until no third call for back light, while
hurt fowls creep to their sedge and

Invites a co-orbital issue: front delivery
on a dropped cartel is the rule
of this account. Make ready the fresh
bout of inshore welding and you can
Relinquish at its best what cloys hardly
and saves time. Like grape-shot
in a founder's garden the bees cluster,
the shrunk figure is so flattened out
And so deedy by bent fingers joined
for a novel immunity. It is plain terror,
sifted to wholemeal with double glazing
and gracious sashcords. What is

In the petition of less for less. At the
limit the sound pins an ice halo about
flaring echoes, going aside at the ring,
22° in the Rotunda itself
Where white roots dissemble and crack,
faces set against payouts. What
you get you fear to want as the round

And so the leaves are stiff, pleated
like rippled ash-cloud and so

in unyielding, abundant gratitude.

(1994)

The Stony Heart of Her
At leisure for losing outward in a glazed toplighi
bringing milk in, another fire and pragma cape
upon them both; they'll give driven to marching
with wild fiery streaks able. Will either sermon
sift over, down with his line, ripped away on a plain
deception: nothing to save on this boiling turn. For
even I speak to her the sun was lowered, at bulk
modified by excluded point failure, did ever she
know it, saving the infant a place ahead by her
mission grab to repair both. For the escape drill
blanks, in teeth of surmised streamers in white,
valeur aux tenebres. f l o w much would be visible
to set up a fish wire, meat in his face as a fire
clay marker. Dash out the very first answer fast,
see here she hears the assay debenture, her peak
sail crowds white under. Slow parting with a crack.
Light distracted from its vent holding will so
grace a line blunted, she said: for all of it
miss a rock indifferently. Overt play over tints
hardly the brackish surplus, where else to be
more careful yet with my blood still. Save whom
in fancy sent away, both will do if as by choice
made ready by vocals. Now washing the front place
quickly, speak to her: on tap here, here, here.

410

What She Saw There
Alter as yet not anguish, choice unwaxed they will
begin the prospectus here, in the overload bay
at a stretch giv ing fresh two. What did she hear,
neither fully approaching there ever towards
the rally diminished. Adroit lowered counts
minding, grown elusive in a split bill, is
that it even. They run a bind forward if touched
to pass pass a trail of cut assets, and a new
skill gazette in alleviation. To the furnace
awake enhanced, what did she really see,
under donated in the dwell back, allowing ever
for another not yet primed. Each of them puts
the list up. at perfection's stoop and the green
is excessive for a slide in brief. That's the
evaporated cruise line advancing by novice
assent availing ready, intervals which even strike
the blaze they overlook at will. Aviators may
join this fork out cheaply and livid on a par
with grades of bliss settled, what for her was
it exactly, how matched to a head. They get
grateful over by harsh guess-work, no other
time offends this. E giorno fatto. What then
did she hear, what did she see, what brittle for
her was it exactly, at the price she paid.

411

Then So Much She Did
On the fade still branching to fall, is her reflex nearer
to take it, in a coffered doorway: for a moment at feed
cramp there, only for issue. As a curtain in blue rises
with tampered billows gone over, listen out, spending
targets thin and browned, for narrow narrow it advances
a break in acceptance, then back. Had better fit a new
minimum for asking as seen almost clearly, you say
too random fairly. You say I do less: then back. Middleground decisive request stop to fall, quietly docs its
inner part. And if I knew I'd say I would, level off
at the light spin of a radiance was it, over to rational
earshot. Attack the loop bravely, momently in a good
heart first, partial not later. Synoptic. If I still caught
the view does she know it is seen, how other like made
adhesive upon a clouded aspect. Fresh legions get on
reader docking, on to a limb following the now often dazed
declensions apart. Her reflex nearer still, gapes where
in free. No sound issues for a pass key to the frame,
alleging mutation for a start astounded here. Infer
this override by the park signal, hers for sure true,
out of all mind lesions finely displayed she takes out
an age entire. Black around, eye level set to see
the line fed through, fruit on its matching tree. To say
so only: she, she, she, and only she: then nearly back.

412

Attending Her Aggregate, Detour
Service also reformed to a bench position, tended evenly
through oat refringence, why does it shake at a done-out
tabular entry; can't she see the self difference or is it
not set in pure gum for a notebook. Sedge emptied says
to go round, burning an old dish with its alkyl spectrum
announced on a late pandemic. Pick your own cell for mean
further. All granted, old meat on a dish. Her step pervades
the slashed shelf life here to utter startled bleeding, that
can't be right, loaded entry starv ation gives over at last

inserts, seldom, often, frankly. Ask for less, averting
trembled fermentation, won't you believe the upper planar
necessity of the whole device. The thing put on there. Even
steadily shocked by the glass screen, the detriment agrees
all such novel flows on impulse. In a tumbler, almost now
on edge seen to fly, won't she notice for a blank advice
coming back; infusing the plant left off. Tell him a top limit
assigned. Automatic reflux bars the open spot too near,
not closed, hardly marked. The clause I give, sweet vernal
abscission, don't take on so. Abandon, abundant, level
late-kerb majority at glowing temper. Really hers. Track
now into a vivid parchment stub, its since belated yet
flight call torn out by inversion. Go with us, and all
the haunt be ours to the premium ground turn allowed.

413

Well Enough in Her Killing Alter
So far the slope drifts in, often it does. Furnishing
a new track or late to consult, all by the way brought
together, a trial to go on. Be gentle be just, afoot trim
postal refinements, trim ducting on a wave. Your life
chances this too, goes openly to let her simply rev eal
time after time found; the little pieces of the whole body
invented as lucid driftwork. We'll consent, won't that
firm up the same border edging, to recoup a simmer often
less for you, freehand real and forgetful. Heart so far
the wrist will melt, of morning light impending: no safe
place or for my head than held, inside the fold the foot
rest in blue. Attain life blood, unblamed by the trail
following out her candour there; she'll take access
across fixed eye jolts worn. Will you walk on the path
so farfetched and reached away in bantered coeval motion,
calmly surprising and abrupt. Was it to reclaim this
profile, was it in form supplied to voice precision;
why would she next disclaim or stray back, at least below
step-wise exchange in tread over. Go for this slope
you know, is it fluent to a gaze; simple incision tags
collect for slips and lapping arms, or a breezy hint
slowly felt light. Dart laps French too. Even to place
the voice at fresh extent won't yet fill assignment,
never so far pitched to gear up or write favour down.

414

Openly She Counts in the Same
By now Hit to fled, put your hand across he said to
a file taking intimate convulsion: level at the throat
of nearly glad rages, a gully retired. Isn't a fast
grazing stop as stupefied anyway, to split the list
between field trips. What is this void now bled from.
Her look attracts the hour to wait, how not to take back
obdurate gap outflow or in a similar tied division;
she plays thus longer a thoracic sink in fine array.
Not come out to stay, whoever looks into the camera
goes for nothing so-called when 1 bite the stone,
you'd watch the yield instead. Otherwise mingle within
the river scene, soon dark enough she won't stand
for as did we laugh now, in order alia breve got
together plied. Speak what, don't look, the fresh gate
repeals instantly the sound within. Exit the bloodyoung watchers: yourself alone. Even so willing to lag
half back from revised shots, what try as they might
is hard to come by in slow recall. The voices bell
on the spur, heard clear in front, go as we must.
In avid incident no more but the brim fills right up
to make a dash outward; to run this at a novel snip
for all found. Sight unseen you lead, tied to the band
in short repeats as for ever and ever bright-eyed,
abraded by tick link succession in demand restored.

Thai Now She Knows
Who with he'll say climbing, to let blood slit imposed
at a turret elevation to buffer high return. I saw
her wings in speedy strip like a shadow in the sand
or in growth like natural reason, her heart so vast
as justly to make cause with the fiery fountain sealed
on track right across terra ntillius overhead. I knew
that, she made me see the light level cracking along
her trebled skyline: I held my view. Blizzard loyal
transgenic pulsation she'll take both up to a dish
off the bone dropping away to a strut canopy, eyes
blue on blue aptitude so sweet. I knew that. Evenly
spaced night flares restore format, leaked to mounting
offshore redemptions; alive droning above tumbled cloud
for my soft convergence, mine only, only mine. Only
too small to hold its blood within her option wrappers
that stake out, spilled through leaves. light of unclosed
life comes back, true beyond p/e overturning upfront
foliar feeds here, its sherbet nectary. This is now
a neat equator or its departure lounge, she closely runs
as animals will breathe out, he grasping at critical
backflow fade. Please delete, don't sleep yet, not
too sure to get shot through upstream. I know that what
you set under a minded shade tree is hit by first debate
and the air locks in, at a dab rack roaming the field.

Both ponder mercy. Overt crushing across the temple

Its bark declining splits up a magnate loosely tied

In green return, in demented tribunal

so laid in earth to mark a void.
Spare ribs, new knees, trash from the pitch

Hope for help in the gallery

But where is the music, the music
all on yonder green hill?
So turning and twirling asunder

As to go for a dancer in yellow,
for to dance to the far brim,
all in yellow, all in yellow sliding

In ages past the cover thickens,
clouds bank in the sky;
the leaves go down, all in yellow

Damp top level, checking for a slide away

Yet valid at the counter as on high seas

Up in sparkling glee, over wide salt sea

Across the thread a hooked undertow

Newly arise the classics in paraphrase,
newly prccentral in a livid bond
to touch daylight and brush its wing
fluently, with all found.
And slacken its licks at sunrise refusing
to uprate glitter at a humid loss

gloried favour around the house.
So the rush begins its fervent ransom,

Sessile intrepid yawning they'll barter off
milk-fed error flags, avidly hiked up ahead
for degraded lesions: in brine, digraphic conjugated

insertion, roused in fury!—your bragged synovial
glimmer threshold raves and stamps in garniture,
their boots baffled in shiny wet snow. Did you
assume next to inseminate by trial, his clinic
yearning to clank, to bind over, to fawn
its botched curtailment—spectrum on blank.

Tulip trick and fast, nursed for clover
to share and share a list
franking indusium, the plot of appetite
snaps back before the frost.
Up in arms warming, how sweet to roam
and follow shades from field to field
puckered to an apex: tripped for burning
in smoke for smoke, set mild
And gone that road under by a fathom
circled with fronds, owing that debt
as birds alighting, says she I am all voice
and nothing fit to eat.
The seed searches itself, its sac defunctive
by crow flight pinioned to bind
an open heart upon a table, rigged
ethereal, towards its end.

Or so as softly we can laugh, as sure
and dear at every span
in audit cry, extended memory address
translucent to the bone.
Freely bees awaken, rising to many tasks
in jaunty flights forsaken, turning
enrolled to occupy their sentimental places
and polish off their finer tuning.
Trace the residuals, the throng of men who
surmount dative assignments
as if inching wildly, crazed for upper lights
that flood what they want.
Upon the bed of rock, whose even smile remits
its port in stormy air, her sight
not measured in the leaves of trembling ash
that shade her face from thought.

Time of day pleading attainment
granted to come and go,
loping across wet grass in the small print
to latch on what you know.
Away with cutting over, she'll advise
to mend both shirts, and steal
a heart felt fury, burning up charcoal
in guise for kitchen foil.
What skimpy terror opted to finish
at the far end, for and for;
no pica among these withered leaves
to bind up the sunken floor.
It is not there, away, away to last
a tax reform, uttermost soaked
envelope riding for a tear of water
all wasted, instantly rebuked.

Ever much missed, freedom to make
more graces to shadeits wildish, loose arraignment
under loan to decide.
By marrow bones raking and in clover
seed heads deputed,
incipient literal sense of entry
sets all points muted.
Take her chance, in glances turning
to nourish the day's
constricted tufts, of wall rue
bitter like these
Derisive permuted fictions; each one
discounting as neatly
we can patch a cry, to make clear
honour so quickly.

Chirrup in the morning up on sky
lines ahead, curling
dissident loopy taps to distraction
will take your breath away.
With pear-drop lips of dew a leap
from small tense stranding
gets its benefit for the carpet
threaded into debit type.
Did the swale open, lose design
token borders, the bursting
ribbon fluent with margin overflow
licks up salt on its own.
In trivial deep amazement, murmur
its song in outward seeming
return from a glow foiled to release
its wanton, loving primer.

Nodding, nodding, day out
and in for a sake
how do you do it to see,
arriving so late,
To talk to and fro with each
other renewing and walking,
step for a span wayward in
heart to heart breaking.
Much like waves upon a shore
whose day approaches,
her time ruTtm«ga.<) meet
with joy the face it touches,
And word upon word, step
by next step regaining
they'll walk and talk, wisely
flicker some hope remaining.

after the ovens of the land had been fixed up
with the bellows of stupid amazement,
after the earth had been separated from the sky
making the reeds jump and sway;
in their vermeil enriched cages the gazers
fixed on the Lebanese percentage,
the Armenian star shots from the bridge

a flourish in radius,

along the pediment are for sure
making their mark. Stone and sky
in the free mid-morning light,
pale hands folded on little wrists,

scribbled on her pad; she knew
the dockets flailed in a price sinkage.
Irene took notes at work; but they dropped
right out of view, these low-level war figures
in muzzy profile for a watching brief
from day to day. Or failing to meet the return of gifts
calls down a default curse: more often
it involves a public gift of a large amount
of sugar', like tying a cloth to a tree,

took out by lightest touches, as upon
a forearm quick with tendons
coaxed along the flow axis, of blood
pulsing across the diode grid. The Durchgriff
crack force marked up the calendar, with red letters
ripping its entry to shreds,
she would remember his arm resting like that,
turning just slightly to freeze
the gamut of warning lamps,

2. Hie Opec Fund for International Development:
3. The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa;

The anode potential produces the same effect
in the region near the cathode
as the combined effects of anode and grid
in the corresponding triode.
Oil to sugar the map beds out, open and shut,

You can get the knack of it Pandora said,
by measure or proxy get a move on
in sedimented mirror-image sets:

they went on a rampage,

spun and flying outwards gibber gibber
floored by exposed pavement, Irene,
bank on the grammar flowing
in piedmont heat across the pediment.
Among the Romans the pediment was so much
respected, it was confined entirely
to buildings sacred to their immortal gods.
Just bring one up on the balcony, she said,

I saw the groves of acanthus rise up and bite
the lips of clear morning light, incise
from flourish bantering catches their
tentered falls, uh you did,
what next supreme chicken, set to thaw out
on a bed perused by damaged
root attractions, le roi capon. I saw mounting
hosts of the crowned burger king, dipping
their lancets across crane gantries,
sugar puffs in the orphanage.
Sec without limit the clandestine fury of attack,
hot-bedding in selection the patient wards
by court action, in breeding
barbaric and divulged. All this passed
at review grading astigmatic for the libido,
one thing leading its list
to another, as all things will.

506

It is the- clearance zone in glimpse
through to a graben sump that you descry,
Irene, deserts of close deserving
hydroptic and factorised. Go no further
on chicken wing, count up
to base ten and sink the maze
like dross on a snowbank by signs
of what tells its tale. Slicker bits we get
better options in surgery on a platform,
chanting our targets in market surgeon a new drug release. Added more sugar
at the slush bar to make
a plea for sweeter reasons. Added virtue, new
slave endurance, make the sum. Evenly
both stairways scan and flex
the tropic invert for now,
holding by decommission their parlour antic
rigid in settled silt: the new dnig
is the target.

507

Non-retail fixture pushes on right ahead
case by case spread about
like leaves over railtrack to guide in milk
their phantom dusky limbs; ever to guide
this passage shall th'aerial sprites
fill all their starry lamps
with double blaze, twin flecks
of biting the hand. Yet still they come,
uh bloated threat of entry into a slot
wedged open by start-up costs.
Dear transom split get on deck with this,
the array lies down in flat plan
to resist what anyone
gets told to say is done. Glib lazy mild
steel to foot loading, a side
play draws up its release, Pandora how
could you even think that stuff etc.

508

So in the warm air of the outside where
did the eyes of glory start out from their chairs,
who were the heirs to this,
amazed by fright and frighted by amaze.
At the jetty coign they gave not a toss
or were taxed to share out
for scarlet and crimson just below
the fingernail, two quiet lives.
Uh with dog and bottle, Irene, done up
in quick succession, slick extrusion
of the carnal body image
with all organs on sale, tacit choice
of ethnic origin. You do have
to feel right, in yourself. Or if or may
or why not should you by sham
repro shame fittings as all
along the parapet the muses gazed
and outstared rejection.

509

Back in the kitchen where the lies simmer
in giant vats she picks over
the runner beans for buttering up now
in oral testimony, not overdone or
they'll be mushy and tasteless. In faulted
witness I had to tell her, so bruised
in use value by assailants masked and muted down.
later at the cutaneous Sack of Rome
with nipples bleeding I saw we both
were mutilated as by fierce bites, the word
stripping the tongue by instant
corrosion of lip service. Pandora guzzled
and I did, we were so famished
for blight spores to play
humectant breeding, we desired
all foreign babble for ourselves, cresting
the airstream in bruits,
hearts racing for a novel pit stop.

510

Irene, we are the slave market now
not maybe but crying aloud for master suites,
I can see there the chiefs of staff
in slick plastic barrels sit all around
a table of Tenter Ground, not
our assets pegged out ready to slide
but body by body dismembered, we grope for
them, Irene, we make them frantic,
the children falter in the queue for food
we saw it on TV, I wanted
to cry with a terrible voice, how
scabby you said, they make them
roll their eyes, roll a filmic bandage,
roll hoops down the fun-fair ramp, willing
the chain of causes; sequenced
in credit checks as mort breakers
consumed to a crisp. Flaky redeployment stakes
we could use that, Irene, before
it splits out the kitchen.

511

Right on the nerve uh sweet sugar light!—we
were accused by harsh desire,
desire for goodness and protein bonds,
for sex with our native tongue.
We applied, we tapped on round after round
as cocking our elbows we saw them fall,
hot blowing wind to mock weapon
audit franchise, our amiable
recoil scores for angry sore points.
At the loading ramps of free misery we both
did cry out with ecstatic joy
and not by mistake in gorgeous trip
on the wheel of punishment—
we saw arch after arch pushing up in the colonnade,
the cut-open pediments of classical exits
a canter of promises not quite broken
because made that way, mazy let-outs of style
in designer drug options. We did
cry out, brandish our paltry money, did flaunt
every asset we had.

512

The scores read like this: word ranking
under the Sentences Act gives a choice
of tempers, arbiter's freedom to set out
where the deepest shadows shall fall.
With blood on their hands is a terror attack
on the Jewish state, Antrim west bank,
lemon Kurds. Don't waver, in order
to renounce the use of arms
it is necessary to have weapons to hand
and in hand, preferably
bloodied beyond a doubt. The men
who would use them must be free
credibly to do so if not to do
just that is to be a free choice.
The crime of the rational script permits a script
of crime in time to calibrate the forces
of pent-up sentence: word by word.

513

So it was that Pandora and Irene, the chicks
were donated entirely and waivcred in themselves
and stitched up. This is called The View
from the Balcony', you can
download a copy for your own personal use
whenever you want. Across the back
of Jean Cousin's portrait of Pandora posing as Eve
you can see under the breast-arch
of decayed masonry a distant city crowned
by a giant classical nipple, real cute
but not a patch on a navel to die for. Of course
I knew the children were starving, probably,
that Pandora mostly doesn't miss a trick.
Irene are you still out there,
you'll get burned my sweet, uh never
the prettiest sight. Time
to go in and down, all sore points,
and feed unmixed their flame.

On the track the news radiates like a planet auction,

sucker, the pap is surely toxic, unless the glad
hand goes your way, soft as velvet. The strokes
of the palm not even touched, a waft of livid air
gives the take its donation, sexual preening overtly
lavish in symmetry; your flicker goes to mine and

locks into warranty, well why not. Over lush fields
a rising sun pitches out its sulky damp shadow, in
reminder of cost levels in the benefit stream. Oh
fight this fight or sleep when others wake, the
maze of a shining path leads on without a break;
count the steps in retrospect, burnt umber places
engrossed forever in dumb struck dropped reward.

So by a thousand cuts the sky quivers and re-parts
