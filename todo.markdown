# To do

* Update 'Migration Patterns' citation?
* Check *Paris Review Interviews* citation.
* Add cross-reference to n. 317.
* Add material from Stokes (e.g. p. 16) to Chapter 2.
* '[P]oetic thought does indeed demand the unreserved commitment of the
  poet, deep-down within the choices and judgements of dialectical
  composition; but before the work is completed, the poet must self-remove
  from this location, sever the links not by a ruse but in order to test
  finally the integrity of the results' (Prynne, 'Poetic Thought', pp.
  597--98)---add to Chapter 2 conclusion?
