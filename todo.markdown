# To do

* Make sure apostrophes are watertight
* Correct figure sizes
* Fix Snarkmarket URL
* Fix indentation in main bibliography.
* Update Pound haunting cross-reference.
* Update 'Migration Patterns' citation?
* Convert 'man' line graph to histogram.
* Recapitulate argument about Lewis, Oliver and Upward before *PTM* material?
* Add material from Stokes (e.g. p. 16) to Chapter 2.
* '[P]oetic thought does indeed demand the unreserved commitment of the
  poet, deep-down within the choices and judgements of dialectical
  composition; but before the work is completed, the poet must self-remove
  from this location, sever the links not by a ruse but in order to test
  finally the integrity of the results' (Prynne, 'Poetic Thought', pp.
  597--98)---add to Chapter 2 conclusion?
