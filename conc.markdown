# Conclusion

> *Be influenced by as many great artists as you can, but have the decency either to acknowledge the debt outright, or to try to conceal it* ---Ezra Pound.^[Pound, 'A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste', *Poetry* (March 1913), 200--06 (p. 202).]

Discussions of Prynne's influences are frequently divided along lines of will, choice or intention. On the one hand, he is presented---to some extent correctly---as a sort of polymath, evincing a deep knowledge both of the literary matters that constitute his immediate field of professional expertise and of a surprisingly disparate range of other subjects, including the technical and the scientific. This is a level of influence which might be described as deliberate, and whose already considerable scope seems to expand with every new reading of Prynne's work. When poetic influence in the more conventional, involuntary sense is discussed, however, Prynne appears as the product of a highly restricted field: Ezra Pound, Charles Olson, Ed Dorn and perhaps two or three more canonical poets such as Wordsworth are the only figures regularly acknowledged as major influences on Prynne's work, despite his evidently close and prolonged reading of scores of other poets, both in English and in other languages. This thesis has made the implicit case for a new category of more or less involuntary influences situated chronologically in the period 1955--75 and geographically in Britain. These influences differ from one another not only in content, but also structurally, and can be summarised as follows. The first is the literary and literary-critical infrastructure represented by the poetry of the Movement and the criticism of F.R. Leavis, as well as their respective and mutual offshoots, considered in Chapter 1. Absorbed pedagogically and institutionally through the relatively homogeneous environments of the 1950s public school and Cambridge college, the traces of these influences accordingly emerge in the most pedagogical and institutional aspects of Prynne's life and work: the early lecture text on Victorian poetry, for example, or his much later notes for English students at Caius. The broadest of the three fields of influence examined in this thesis, it is also the most conventional, both in its bid for cultural dominance and in its mode of operation. The second is the British side of the avant-garde little magazine scene towards which Prynne turned in the early 1960s, as described in Chapter 2. While apparently voluntary, this turn loses some of its force when the paucity of alternative options for publication and distribution is considered, Prynne having by this point decisively rejected the mainstream channels offered by a figure like Donald Davie. Unlike the form of influence described in the previous chapter, in which specific critical attitudes or tenets are either adopted or negated, this *milieu* makes its influence felt structurally, as the material context in which Prynne's legible thought takes place. Accordingly, its effect is more like a negative imprint: its trace appears at the very moment that Prynne attempts to reach beyond it, most obviously in his letter to Peter Riley of 15 September 1967 and in the prose piece 'A Note on Metal'. The third and final field of influence explored in this thesis is more diffuse, being represented by the fiction of Wyndham Lewis, Edward Upward and Douglas Oliver, discussed alongside a number of other points of reference---notably the scientific work of Francis Crick and Joseph Needham---in Chapter 3. In this case, the mode of operation is a combination of the previous two: Prynne does not merely adopt elements of these writers' work in his own prose, nor does he simply write against or around them. Rather, Prynne's works and those of the authors already mentioned are symptoms of a broader nexus of conscious and unconscious concerns which comes into focus when they are read together. This nexus is comprised primarily of anxieties about national identity, sexual maturity and reproduction.

The conjunction of these anxieties or concerns and their applicability to a number of other areas of Prynne's work was discussed at the end of Chapter 3, but, beyond the localised concept of the 'good scientist', the composite that they form was not given a name. By way of conclusion, this thesis will test out one such name: fatherhood. From the implantation and nurturing of a literary sensibility in the mind of a child to the creation of the autonomous, resistant poem, and even to the 'seeding' of Earth itself, the structure of male reproduction---initial contact followed by withdrawal, tempered in some cases by periodic re-engagement---seems to sit behind much of what matters most deeply to the Prynne that emerges in the foregoing pages. Ironically, this conclusion has been reached through a mode of analysis that has striven precisely to avoid any simply 'patrilineal' model of poetic descent---what Andrea Brady terms 'fantasies of all-male reproduction'---particularly the Pound--Olson--Prynne structure presented in works such as Mellors's *Late Modernist Poetics*.^[Brady, p. 245.] As far as this thesis is concerned, Prynne's aesthetic, intellectual and ethical stance is the product of an almost infinitely diverse (though differentially weighted) pool of influences. Yet the stance itself undeniably emphasises processes with a structural similarity to patrilineal descent. Is this a straightforward return of the repressed, either at the level of the present work or at that of its subject? A more accurate assessment would emphasise the inextricability---even the mutually constitutive nature---of different types and processes of influence.

It was claimed in the introduction to this thesis that Pound would 'haunt every one of the following chapters'. What, then, is the structure of this 'haunting', and what does it say about that which it affects? Like Prynne, Pound is a poet concerned at a deep level with problems of reproduction: one of the crucial charges against 'usura' in Canto XLV, arguably the centre-piece of the long poem that represents Pound's lifework, is that it 'slayeth the child in the womb'.^[Pound, 'XLV', in *The Cantos of Ezra Pound* (New York: New Directions, 1996), 229--30 (p. 230).] Very much unlike Prynne, Pound is scrupulous and clear in his acknowledgement of influences.^[This is not to suggest that Prynne is in any sense unaware of issues of poetic fatherhood and influence; self-conscious tics in his correspondence, such as referring to Donald Davie by his initials (D.A.D.), show that he is very much aware of them.] The most famous example of such acknowledgement is the early poem 'A Pact', a short piece in which Pound explicitly positions himself in filial relationship to Walt Whitman: 'I come to you as a grown child | Who has had a pig-headed father; | I am old enough now to make friends.' Pound presents his task as one of refinement: 'It was you that broke the new wood, | Now is a time for carving.'^[First appearing in *Poetry* (April 1913), pp. 11--12, the poem was accompanied on its second page by 'In a Station of the Metro', a piece whose 'wet, black bough' constitutes a direct development of the 'new wood' that 'A Pact' attributes to Whitman.] Prynne's *oeuvre* contains no such direct statement of influence. Yet, as was pointed out at the beginning of this thesis, the intellectual and contextual correspondences between Pound and Prynne are numerous, and far more compelling than any equivalent similarities with, say, Olson or Dorn. In particular, the blistering scorn of Prynne's private and semi-private tirades against poetic stupidity---matched only by the intellectual, social and even financial generosity of his attempts to support and promote those writers whose work he has considered important---is a characteristic which cannot but be linked to the author of 'How to Read'. If Pound is to be considered a poetic 'father' to Prynne, it is in precisely the sense identified above: a relationship characterised by withdrawal and absence, but which can with effort be read backwards. The apparent conflict between the disparate influences identified in this thesis and grand theories of patrilineal poetic descent might therefore be dispelled by seeing Pound and his career as a sort of over-arching formal influence within which more local influences (Davie, Tomlinson, Leavis, etc.) emerge as content: an image of the father as a matryoshka doll containing a set of successively shrinking sub-fathers.^[Pound is perhaps even akin to the symbolic father described by Jacques Lacan, whose 'true function [...] is fundamentally to unite (and not to set in opposition) a desire and the Law' (Jacques Lacan, *Ã‰crits: A Selection*, trans. by Alan Sheridan [London: Tavistock Publicatons, 1977], p. 321).] The apparent genealogical absolutism of this perspective is tempered if Pound is understood as one formal structure or 'concept' among many; thus, a thesis which took Olson rather than Pound as its implicit concept may have come up with a quite different set of emphases and influences (or *vice versa*), even where these influences have only a formal or structural rather than a direct relation to Olson himself. It is important to acknowledge such underlying concepts, even and especially when they only emerge into view at the end of a process of argumentation which they have helped to structure. Through reflection on the concept as a crystallisation of the material that produces it (and that it produces), that material can be viewed from a bird's-eye perspective structurally impossible in the analysis itself.

In the present case, the fact that a particularly patrilineal, Poundian air emerges from a consideration of Prynne's early career has the potential to shed further light on the periodisation of his work. Would the selection of a period other than 1955--75 for contextual analysis---say, the period from the publication of *Poems* in 1982 to Prynne's retirement from academic life in 2005---have thrown up a different concept? Furthermore, what do the qualitative aspects of the concept that has emerged say about that which they structure? The model of poetic inheritance set out above is, for one thing, explicitly androcentric: descent is based structurally on the male side of the reproductive process, with almost no regard for the female.^[To take an obvious example, in Prynne's discussion of Shelley and Malthus in relation to contemporary reproductive policy, women are viewed as mechanical functions in a bio-economic system regulated primarily by male legislators. While a charitable interpretation would claim that it is precisely this system which Prynne is arguing *against*, it is nevertheless the case that the argument takes place within a material intellectual context---*The English Intelligencer*---which is only marginally less male-dominated than the 44th Parliament itself. Of the 66 recipients listed in the *Intelligencer*'s last and longest circulation list ('Certain Matters', in *Certain Prose*, 2:['Ghost Issue'] [G16--17], pp. 173--75), five are women, a rate of less than eight per cent. The equivalent rate for the House of Commons after the 1966 election was approximately four per cent ('Women MPs & parliamentary candidates since 1945', *UK Political Info*, \<http://www.ukpolitical.info/FemaleMPs.htm\> [accessed 2 February 2016]). In any case, few of the female recipients of the *Intelligencer* participated actively in its discussions.] Any conception of poetic creation based even metaphorically on a 'natural' view of sexual reproduction is also heteronormative. To raise these issues is not simply to nitpick from a more enlightened cultural-historical position. It is not clear that poets' thinking about poetry can be placed on an (ideally) ever-advancing political timeline in the manner of, say, civil rights legislation, and even if it could it is not obvious that any advance which would afford the contemporary critic a privileged vantage point has in fact taken place. What is clear is that andro- and heteronormativity are recognisable parts of Prynne's thinking about aesthetic practice in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s---broadly encapsulated in the 'good scientist' trope described at the end of Chapter 3---rather than unfortunate aberrations to be explained away. The chronological qualifier in the last sentence is necessary, and---if a poet's thinking about poetry can be assumed to leave a trace in the work itself---the restriction it imposes is to some extent backed up by statistics. Figure @fig:man shows the results of analysing concatenated scanned texts of *Force of Circumstance* and the 2005 edition of *Poems* according to a very crude approximation of andronormativity: appearances of the word 'man'---used either as a singular noun or to refer to 'mankind'---per 1,000 lines.^[The usage of similar terms such as 'human' or 'woman' across the text does not show any comparable trend.] For reference, the chronological scope of this thesis terminates with *High Pink on Chrome* (1975) at around l. 8,350. While naturally limited, such analysis has the advantage of being less susceptible to disagreement than, say, a localised reading of a number of uses of the word: as with phenomena such as bias in the justice system or Hollywood typecasting, individual instances are readily disputable, long-term patterns less so.^[Without claiming it as 'seal of approval' for the statistical approach, it is interesting to note that Prynne himself has made use of similar analyses; discussing his compositional process in 2014, he described checking words against a digital text of his collected poems to review past usages (Prynne, 'A Dialogue with Nicholas Royle').]

Writing to Douglas Oliver in 1994 on the subject of intellectual and ethical consistency, Prynne claims that 'it is not facile to speak of ethical style, and to recognise that even within a single lifetime there is room for many shifts which can nonetheless preserve a thread of purposeful mutation.'^[Prynne to Oliver, 5 September 1994.] This implicitly genetic model, in which the subject is neither absolutely changeable nor absolutely consistent, is perhaps helpful in coming to terms with Prynne's own evolving opinions. For his part, Prynne is well aware of changes in his own thinking and practice, acknowledging later in the same letter that 'my own habit now is sharply altered from only a few years back.' Indeed, in the recent lecture-essay 'The Poet's Imaginary', which presents a conception of poetic composition as involving a sort of introjected double-self, Prynne tackles the relation between poetry and gender directly:

> the dyadic relation of poet and imaginary [...] may not be accompanied by determined gender assignments. Either figure may be male or female, or may include features of both, like a system of Christian angels who, rather than owning no sexual identity at all, may present as equally responsive to both genders and both bodily incarnations, in cherishment and in trust.^[Prynne, 'The Poet's Imaginary', p. 104.]

To go on to criticise this statement for the binarism of a phrase like 'both genders and both bodily incarnations' would be to hold Prynne to an absurdly high standard, at least in a cultural context where such conceptions remain overwhelmingly dominant. Earlier in the essay, Prynne writes that 'being a good poet and continuing to meet the self-challenge of not lapsing into mediocrity is continuously difficult, a matter of struggle not easily handled because intrinsically hard to recognize accurately'.^[Prynne, 'The Poet's Imaginary', p. 96.] Part of this difficulty---and something that Prynne has striven consistently to do throughout his mature career---is to acknowledge the intersection of the poetic and the political, even when they appear to be most separate, and especially when the content of the latter is necessarily remote from the poet's own personal experience.

To return to fatherhood, a powerful example of the young Prynne's negotiation of interlocking obligations and dependencies is provided by an uncollected early poem, a translation of Guido Cavalcanti's sonnet *Chi Ã¨ questa*:

> Who is it, that  
> in coming thus is  
> so admired  

> the air lucid  
> with shaking  
> brightness  

> beside her  
> the very person  
> of love?  

> No man may  
> speak, except  
> to sigh  

> the turning glance!  
> love must say  
> that, not I  

> such containment  
> makes those around  
> her seem gestures, of rage  

> she gathers the  
> virtues to her  
> finest pleasing : no 

> words show her  
> goddess  
> of beauty 

> such height  
> the mind  
> has not known  

> nor such favour  
> that ever, truly  
> we might^[Prynne, 'Chi Ã‰', *Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), p. 35.]

This is not a work which came down to Prynne unfiltered from the *Duecento*: translated twice by Pound, it isÂ discussed at length in Chapter VI of Donald Davie's *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*, parts of which 'derive immediately from conversations with J.H. Prynne'.^[Donald Davie, *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*, p.Â vi. Mellors goes so far as to claim that the chapter was 'written with [Prynne's] assistance' (Mellors, p. 73). It was in any case published in 1964, the same year as Prynne's translation.] Davie quotes Pound's translations---the first from 1912, the second from 1929---in full, 'tak[ing] for granted that [the latter] is more to modern taste', then attempts to explain why.^[Davie, *Ezra Pound*, p. 105. Pound's translations were first published respectively in Pound, *Sonnets and Ballate of Guido Cavalcanti* (London: Stephen Swift and Co., 1912), p. 29 and Pound, 'Guido's Relations',Â *The Dial*, 86 (July 1929), 559--68 (p.Â 56).] The chief differences between the two, as identified by Davie, are a shift from relatively strict pentameter to a more varied metrical pattern, and a shift from Standard English diction and orthography with the occasional archaic abbreviation (''tis', 'ne'er') to an entirely archaic mode of presentation reminiscent of 16th-century English poets such as Thomas Wyatt ('makyng the air to tremble with a bright clearenesse'). Davie cites Pound's own denunciation in *Make it New* of the 'prevalent error [...] of dealing with Italian hendecasyllables as if they were English "iambic pentameter"', along with his assertion that 'Dante's hendecasyllables were composed of combinations of rhythm units of various shapes and sizes'.^[Pound, 'Cavalcanti', in *Literary Essays of Ezra Pound*, ed. by T.S. Eliot (London: Faber and Faber, 1954), 149--200 (p. 169).] 'Although Pound goes on to claim that he had discovered this for himself "in Indiana"', writes Davie, 'his versions of 1912 do not suggest as much.'^[Davie, *Ezra Pound*, p. 106.] Having further compared this use of 'rhythm units' to Pound's practice in the Chinese translations of *Cathay* (1915), Davie draws the following conclusion:

> Because for purposes of polemic Pound chose at times to play the iconoclast, it is easy to see his abandonment of the traditional pentameter as something deliberate and programmatic; his translations of Cavalcanti from 1912 onwards suggest on the contrary that he broke with the pentameter reluctantly, grudgingly, and, as it were, of necessity.^[*Ibid*., p. 107.]

In the case of archaism, Davie pays attention specifically to l. 10 of the original---'*Ch'a lei s'inchina ogni gentil vertute*'---translated by Pound as 'For all the noble powers bend toward her' and 'In that every high noble vertu leaneth to herward'. He refers again to criticism, noting how in the introduction to *Sonnets and Ballate* Pound dissents from Dante Gabriel Rossetti's rendering, 'To whom are subject all things virtuous.' In the Italian, according to Pound, '"she" acts as a magnet for every "gentil virtute," that is, the noble spiritual power, the invigorating forces of life and beauty bend toward her'; Rossetti errs in failing to emphasise this active movement.^[Pound, *Sonnets and Ballate*, p. 5.] As Davie points out,

> [i]n both of Pound's versions this meaning of *s'inchina* is duly reproduced[. ...] But it is in the later version that the point is rammed home, that the difference between Rossetti's version and Pound's is made irreconcilable. This is a function of the much denser and more conspicuous archaism of the revised version; in other words, the much heavier archaism of the second version is not for the sake of loftiness and ornateness, but, on the contrary, it serves to cleave more closely to the sense as Pound perceives it.^[Davie, *Ezra Pound*, pp. 108--09.] 

How, if at all, does Prynne's translation fit into this narrative of progress provided by Davie? Its most obvious departure is formal. Where Pound's versions follow the two-quatrain, two-tercet layout of the original, Prynne's is composed of ten tercets, with very short lines of between two and five words. These lines are a clear attempt to replicate the 'rhythm units of various shapes and sizes' described by Pound, yet in a new arrangement. In translating *Chi Ã¨ questa*, Pound avoids marking these units formally, though he does so in his version of Cavalcanti's *Donna mi prega* by 'spacing out the line in print, making it float or step across, as well as down, the printed page'.^[*Ibid*., p. 112. As Davie notes, this is a technique now more closely associated with the work of William Carlos Williams, who nevertheless 'seized' it from Pound.] Prynne goes one further, 'breaking the pentameter' almost completely by denying any possibility of its reconstitution through left-right eye movement.^[Of the poem's ten stanzas, only two contain exactly ten syllables, the rest ranging from seven to 14.] The significance of this arrangement is revealed by the later stages of Davie's chapter, in which he discusses an apparent contradiction: enjambment, as the 'metrical sign of kinetic energy, of impetus', requires a relatively consistent metrical structure as a backdrop, something which is disrupted by the 'rhythmical dismemberment of the verse line from within' which Pound sought.^[*Ibid*., p. 118.] According to Davie, Pound's translations therefore lack consistent movement, petrifying into individual lines; writing of 'South-Folk in Cold Country' from *Cathay*, he claims that 'of the lines in this poem it seems more accurate to say that they are placed one beneath another, than to say that one comes after another.'^[*Ibid*.] There can be few clearer examples of lines 'placed one beneath another' than Prynne's version of *Chi Ã¨ questa*; yet it is also a poem which is relentlessly enjambed, including by a dramatic jump over the seventh stanza break. This ambiguous 'no', which in its spatial detachment from what follows risks negating the preceding three lines, reads as a deliberate attempt both to outstrip Pound and to prove Davie wrong: to combine enjambment with 'rhythmical dismemberment' in something completely new. At the same time, its separation from 'words show her' allows the whole phrase to be semantically inverted in a moment of textual self-consciousness unprecedented in previous translations: words *do* show her, including at this very moment. This in turn implies something important about what sort of a thing 'she', the 'goddess of beauty', is---namely, a factitious textual construction which is in fact highly amenable to being shown through words.

Nor does Prynne's poem map in any consistent way on to the structure of the original. While the first four tercets neatly represent the first four lines in Cavalcanti, the poem roughly doubles in 'speed' after this point, condensing each of the subsequent three stanzas into two tercets. Ideas from Cavalcanti are also re-ordered: in the original version of the passage quoted above, the conventional expression of incommunicability comes before the section about the virtues. Some of the telescoping of source material is extreme: l. 13 of Prynne's piece, 'the turning glance!', substitutes for a much more semantically complex section, rendered in the later Pound as 'Ah God, what she is like when her owne eye turneth'. Keeping a de-archaised version of the 1929 'turneth' in preference to 1912's 'strays', Prynne nevertheless distils the entire apostrophe to God into an exclamation mark and completely loses the reference to semblance, which in 1912 leads Pound into the unidiomatic 'The thing she's like'. Prynne makes similarly free with the basic grammar of crucial phrases. His implicit intervention in the one-sided dispute between Pound and Rossetti over *s'inchina* is typically blunt: Prynne completely reverses the phrase, transferring grammatical agency from the virtues which 'lean', 'turn' or are 'subject', to the woman who 'gathers' them---she becomes a subject herself. In simplifying grammar, Prynne introduces subtle semantic modifications, as in ll. 25--27: 'such height | the mind | has not known'. 'Has not', here, is a significant step down from '*non fu sÃ¬ alta giÃ *' or Pound's 'ne'er before'/'never before', losing the implication that whatever hasn't been achieved in the past is in fact being achieved now. In Prynne's text, the mind might simply never reach such height. This sense actually corresponds more strictly to the overall meaning of the stanza, and makes possible the poem's final shift: 'nor such favour | that ever, truly | we might' (ll. 28--30). The use of the 'nor' from Pound's 1929 translation disguises a much quicker and cleaner transition from past to future conditional than in the older poet's version, some syntactical complexity notwithstanding. For Prynne, the mind has not (in the past) known such height, nor has it known such favour that we might ever (in the future) truly know such height. As Davie points out, Pound vacillates between reading '*in voi*' and '*in noi*' in the penultimate line of the original, causing the address to change radically.^[*Ibid.*, pp. 105--06.] Prynne completely avoids this issue; the female subject is indeed absent from Prynne's poem by this stage, allowing the focus to settle finally on 'we', the complex formed by the reader and speaker. 

As part of his determination to transform rather than simply to translate Cavalcanti's poem, Prynne deliberately avoids the archaic diction which Davie praises in Pound. Whereas in Davie's assessment 'the much heavier archaism of the second version [...] serves to cleave more closely to the sense as Pound perceives it', Prynne aims for a different sort of accuracy---as the *s'inchina* issue shows, he is not afraid to depart from Pound even when that also means departing from Cavalcanti.^[*Ibid*, p. 109.] Prynne's vocabulary is, then, almost universally mono- or disyllabic, the sole exception being 'containment' in l. 16, a word which serves as a useful test of his principle of selection. Taken for Cavalcanti's  *umiltÃ *, 'containment' is a seemingly inappropriate choice, the former deriving ultimately from the Latin *humilitas*, literally the quality of being close to the ground (*humus*). The development of *umiltÃ * into *omertÃ *, with its connotations of organisational secrecy and exclusiveness, may provide one way back to Prynne's usage, as might the modern English injunction to 'contain oneself'. More important, however, is the sound link with the etymologically and semantically unrelated *cotanto* in the original line, '*Cotanto d'umiltÃ  donna mi pare*': through careful selection, Prynne induces an echo across languages and centuries, without sacrificing the sleekness and 'containment' of his own poem. The introduction of 'those around' in the following line---'such containment | makes those around | her seem gestures, of rage' (ll. 16--18)---siphons off the word's remaining obtrusiveness, making it part of a broader spatial structure, a system of interiors and exteriors.

In translating *Chi Ã¨ questa*, Prynne could hardly have selected a poem more heavily freighted with both literary-historical and personal significance, already translated not once but twice by the totemic father of poetic modernism and discussed at length by his own sometime *Doktorvater* in *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*. The translation's significance is further heightened by its appearance in Issue 6 of *Prospect*, a publication whose aesthetic importance for Prynne as editor was described at length in Chapter 2. (The poem in fact appears on the page without any suggestion that it is a translation, the reader's familiarity with its convoluted history being taken for granted.) The four poems of Prynne's included in *Prospect* 6 are sandwiched tightly between work by Olson and Davie, the two influences most frequently acknowledged in introductions to Prynne's work. They are far from being homogenous, however: 'Chi Ã‰' is in fact markedly different in style from its neighbours, all three of which read like offcuts from *Force of Circumstance*, sharing that volume's concern for the natural world and commitment to relatively conventional stanza forms.^[While they certainly show more of Olson's influence than some of the poems in *Force of Circumstance*, 'Salt Water, Fresh Water', 'At the Dark Centre' and 'Lie of the Other Land' were all read by Prynne for a recording accompanying his 1964 interview with Peter Orr; all of the other poems read were taken from his debut collection.] In summary, then, *Chi Ã¨ questa*  was carefully and deliberately selected, its translation composed in a strategically audacious style and published in a manner which ensured that it stood out, Prynne himself having absolute control over presentation. It is thus a rare and important instance of near-explicit acknowledgement on Prynne's part of poetic influence and inheritance, phenomena which more often remain subterranean presences in his work, and even in his correspondence. This perhaps accounts for the fact that 'Chi Ã‰' has never been collected in *Poems*, sharing this status with *Force of Circumstance*---a volume heavily indebted both to Davie and to Charles Tomlinson---and a handful of other individual pieces.

That Prynne's aversion to simple acknowledgements of influence has persisted more or less consistently throughout his career can be seen by looking at the dedications included---or more often not included---in his books. While Prynne includes dedications in his very earliest major collections, *Force of Circumstance* and *The White Stones*, these are non-literary, to his English teacher and his wife respectively. The elegy 'Es Lebe der KÃ¶nig', published in *Brass* and dedicated to Paul Celan, is exceptional, and has rightly been read as such: in fact, it sits in a twenty-year period from 1969 to 1988 in which Prynne used no other dedications at all.^[Prynne, 'Es Lebe der KÃ¶nig', in *Poems* (2015), p. 169--70.] *Word Order* (1989) is dedicated to an unidentified 'J.P.', who may be Prynne's daughter, but it is not until the 1990s that clear dedications to poets reappear: *Not-You* (1993) is dedicated to 'Che Qian-zi and Zhou Ya-ping | and [...] the ORIGINALS', a group of Chinese poets, while the 1999 Bloodaxe edition of *Poems* is dedicated to Prynne's French translator, Bernard Dubourg. As will by now be obvious, none of the poets mentioned above wrote or write in English; the potential for their dedications to be read as acknowledgements of influence, at least in a conventional sense, is thus severely restricted. In fact, Prynne's first dedication to a poet who wrote in English---if not an English poet---does not come until 2005, fully fifty years after the beginning of his poetic career, with the offering of the second Bloodaxe edition of *Poems* to Ed Dorn, who died in 1999. As was suggested above, if simple, poet-to-poet processes of influence are difficult to detect in conventional, textually focussed readings of Prynne's work, the identification of more complicated and systemic cultural patterns is practically impossible. Once the critical lens is refocussed, however, Prynne's status as the product of a pre-existing, mid-20th-century literary tradition is not at all difficult to see, emerging in areas as seemingly banal as his professional name. As Terry Eagleton notes in a recent review of D.J. Taylor's *The Prose Factory*,

> [t]he Victorians did not generally call themselves by the initials of their first two names plus their surname [...] and neither do most authors from roughly the second half of the 20th century onwards. [...] Between these two periods, however, this largely male habit of self-designation spreads thick and fast: H.G., T.S., W.B., E.M., D.H., L.P., W.H. and so on. No doubt some doctoral student will one day explain why.^[Terry Eagleton, 'A Toast at the Trocadero', *London Review of Books*, 38.4 (18 February 2016), 9--10 (p. 10).]  

Eagleton goes on to offer a few explanations of his own---'a certain English stiffness', 'the doctrine of aesthetic impersonality, which was in fashion at the time'---but the reasons are hardly as important as the simple fact that such a tendency is identifiable. That Prynne's adoption of the style is a deliberate choice rather than a reversion to default is shown, paradoxically, by the indecision with which it is made. Prynne's first published poem, in the 1955 sixth-form magazine *Six*, is credited to 'J.H.', yet as late as *Prospect* 6, two years after the publication of *Force of Circumstance* (also 'J.H.'), he is listed as 'Jeremy'. The style would of course have been familiar from institutional contexts: the Jesus College yearbooks for the period of Prynne's undergraduate course consistently initialise names, as do some military records. Prynne's entirely optional decision to adopt it for literary purposes, however, signals a claim to occupy a certain tradition, the more so as the style had clearly gone out of fashion by the 1960s---in contemporary magazines, Prynne's is often the only initialised name on the contents page, and in circulation lists for *The English Intelligencer* he is accompanied only by his college friend R.F. Langley.^[Notices, in *Certain Prose*, 1:11 [173], pp. 24--25; 'Roll Call', in *ibid*., 1:15 [266], pp. 78--79.] In Prynne's case, that tradition might owe as much to, say, R.P. Blackmur, the American poet and critic cited in 'Resistance and Difficulty', as it does to T.S. Eliot or even F.R. Leavis. Nevertheless, it *is* a tradition, and an eminently mainstream one at that.

As much as identifying particular traditions and histories which impinge on the work of Prynne's early career, the task of this thesis has been to make the simple point that such impingement happens at all. Even in the present context of increasing scholarly interest in Prynne, and despite the deeply historical tendencies of both his poetic and his critical work, this remains what he would term a 'non-trivial pursuit'.^[Prynne, 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', p. 141. The use of 'non-trivial', a loan from the vocabulary of mathematics, is itself an example of such historical-contextual influence.] Introducing the recent *Cambridge Introduction to British Poetry, 1945--2010*---notable for its acknowledgement of Prynne's important place in 20th-century literary history---Eric Falci mounts an extended defence of his essentially historicist critical approach, summarised in the following statement: 'History doesn't determine form, but a poem is nonetheless marbled by its context.'^[Eric Falci, *The Cambridge Introduction to British Poetry, 1945--2010* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015), p. 3.] This is, broadly speaking, the principle which guides the reading of 'Chi Ã‰' given above. Though well-formulated, it is striking that Falci feels moved to express it in such defensive terms, effectively denying in the first clause what he goes on to affirm---albeit in a weakened form---in the second. Falci's statement is expressive of a contradiction in a certain branch of contemporary literary history, in which materialism must be affirmed at the same time as a taboo against biographical criticism is upheld. The structural implications of the marbling analogy are revealing: history gets *into* poems, like a mineral impurity, rather than shaping them from outside, and it does so automatically and without mediation. This might at first glance seem to be Prynne's own position, epitomised in the sarcastic remark from 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work': 'Look, the poet is wearing red socks! Now at last we understand everything!'^[Prynne, 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', p. 130.] Yet everywhere from undergraduate teaching notes to his published commentaries on Wordsworth and George Herbert, Prynne makes extensive and unapologetic use of biographical material---not as 'colour' for the main analysis, but as a fundamental tool, showing *how* history gets where it does.^[An example from Prynne's notes for students on Pound was given in this thesis's introduction. In the case of Herbert, he goes so far as to lament the lack of available biographical information, particularly about Herbert's library and reading habits (Prynne, 'George Herbert, "Love [III]"', p. 16).]

As long as literary analysis is restricted to the texts of individual poems and not extended to the poets who produce them, as well as to their non-poetic work, much of the historical marbling described by Falci will remain obscure. This point is made not from the standpoint of a decrepit and self-deluding 'common sense' but from that of materialism: to confine historicist analysis to individual texts is an error in the same category as the formalist evacuation of context against which historicist criticism itself reacts. In one of his clearest statements of aesthetic principle, Prynne writes that 'no poet has or can have clean hands, because clean hands are themselves a fundamental contradiction. Clean hands do no worthwhile work.'^[Prynne, 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', p. 141.] That his choice of metaphor is bodily neatly illustrates the point in question. Poems do not get written without hands, and those hands inevitably do other things, from eating hamburgers to filling in ballot papers. This is something, Prynne claims, that he 'ha[s] believed throughout [his] writing career'.^[*Ibid*.] Scholars of Prynne's work owe it to the truth of the first quotation not to take that of the second on trust.
