# Conclusion

> *Be influenced by as many great artists as you can, but have the decency either to acknowledge the debt outright, or to try to conceal it* ---Ezra Pound.^[Pound, 'A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste', *Poetry* (March 1913), 200--06 (p. 202).]

\noindent As much as identifying particular traditions and histories which impinge on the work of Prynne's early career, the task of this thesis has been to make the simple point that such impingement happens at all. Even in the present context of increasing scholarly interest in Prynne, and despite the deeply historical tendencies of both his poetic and his critical work, this remains what he would term a 'non-trivial pursuit'.^[Prynne, 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', p. 141. The use of 'non-trivial', a loan from the vocabulary of mathematics, is itself an example of such historical-contextual influence.]  Introducing the recent *Cambridge Introduction to British Poetry, 1945--2010*---notable for its strong acknowledgement of Prynne's place in 20th-century literary history---Eric Falci mounts an extended defence of his essentially historicist critical approach, summarised in the following statement: 'History doesn't determine form, but a poem is nonetheless marbled by its context.'^[Eric Falci, *The Cambridge Introduction to British Poetry, 1945--2010* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015), p. 3.]  It is striking that Falci describes his approach in such defensive terms, effectively denying in the first clause what he goes on to affirm---albeit in a weakened form---in the second. In seeking to avoid an unfashionably rigid (and implicitly Marxist--Leninist) view of history's relation to culture, replacing it with a metaphorical formulation which will be acceptable to all sides, he risks substantially abandoning historical determination as such, when it is in fact the linchpin of his argument. Falci's statement is expressive of a contradiction in a certain branch of contemporary literary history, in which materialism must be affirmed at the same time as a taboo against biographical criticism is upheld. The structural implications of the marbling analogy are revealing: history gets *into* poems, like a mineral impurity, rather than shaping them from outside, and it does so automatically and without mediation. This might at first glance seem to be Prynne's own position, epitomised in the sarcastic remark from 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work': 'Look, the poet is wearing red socks! Now at last we understand everything!'^[Prynne, 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', p. 130.]  Yet everywhere from undergraduate teaching notes to his published commentaries on Wordsworth and George Herbert, Prynne makes extensive and unapologetic use of biographical material---not as 'colour' for the main analysis, but as a fundamental tool, showing *how* history gets where it does.^[An example from Prynne's notes for students on Pound was given in this thesis's introduction. In the case of Herbert, he goes so far as to lament the lack of available biographical information, particularly about Herbert's library and reading habits (Prynne, 'George Herbert, "Love [III]"', p. 16).]

Any biographically minded approach to Prynne must, nevertheless, contend with the poet's own published comments on the irrelevance of such criticism to his work. This attitude is expressed explicitly in a prose piece from late 2015, a transcription of 'a faxed memorandum sent to [Josh] Kotin and [Jeff] Dolven, who recently interviewed the author for a forthcoming issue of *The Paris Review*.'^[Prynne, 'A Note to Josh Kotin and Jeff Dolven', p. 21.]  Here, discussing the cover images used for the Bloodaxe editions of *Poems*, Prynne acknowledges that '[n]one of these publications shews a human figure, still less an author-likeness', attributing this firstly to his 'well-attested distaste for self-promotion or any kind of personality interest attaching to the writer as the performing origin ("ego scriptor") of text.' He continues:

> The self-life is mere domestic anecdotage, in its original sense, and there is not much overt idea of inherent personal opinion or life-story deployed visibly in my work (though under indirection may be another matter). It is in my view merely vulgar to publish work with your face run up the flagpole, in concession to reader curiosity when close engagement with the interior of writing work will open up many kinds of interiority, yours and mine.^[*Ibid*. The use of 'vulgar' here, though perhaps a deliberate adoption of an expected role, shows the continuing influence of a class-inflected Leavisite antipathy towards popular literature.]

Prynne goes on to discuss what he considers to be a more important reason for avoiding author photos, to do with his own hyper-materialist view of poetic language (the poem, once created, is part of the resistant world external to the subject), but for the purposes of this thesis it is the first explanation which is most interesting. There is a fundamental contradiction implicit in Prynne's statement: disclaiming personal authority in a letter voluntarily sent as part of (or at least in the wake of) an interview for a literary magazine. The interview will form part of what is perhaps the most famous and comprehensive set of interviews with 20th-century writers; interviews, moreover, with an explicitly biographical focus. The blurb for a 2006 collected volume describes the *Paris Review* interviews as 'an essential and definitive record of the writing life.'^[*The Paris Review Interviews*, vol. 1 (New York: Picador, 2006), [dustjacket].]  It is Prynne's first substantial interview since his conversation with Peter Orr for the British Council in 1964 and forms part of a more general easing-up of anti-biographical vigilance in recent years. Representative of this tendency is the 2008 lecture-essay 'Huts', which is peppered with exactly the sort of biographical anecdote which Prynne deplores in his letter to Kotin and Dolven. (In fact, the term 'anecdote' is insufficient, referring etymologically---as Prynne implies in the letter---to 'things unpublished'.^['anecdote, *n*.', *OED Online* (Oxford University Press, 2016), \<http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/7367\> [accessed 29 June 2016].]) Near the beginning of the essay, for example, Prynne remarks that 'those of my generation who can remember being conscripted for National Service will surely recall being assigned to camp huts for training and manifest discomforts; I used to sleep in rolled-up newspaper, in effort to keep out the fierce winds that blew in under the floorboards'.^[Prynne, 'Huts', p. 616.]  Later, he describes visiting huts in China, the Austrian alps and the German *Schwarzwald* over a period of more than forty years. This anecdotal style mirrors that used during readings at the beginning of his career: in his 1971 York Street Commune reading in Vancouver, Prynne covers topics ranging from his evacuation during the Second World War to his neighbours' cat, often spending more time on anecdotes than on the poems themselves.^[Prynne, reading (York Street Commune, Vancouver, 1 August 1971). This apparently time-limited biographical recalcitrance is mirrored in Prynne's attitude to dedications. Prynne includes dedications in his very earliest major collections, *Force of Circumstance* and *The White Stones*---to his English teacher and his wife respectively---but subsequently abandons them. The elegy 'Es Lebe der König', published in *Brass* and dedicated to Paul Celan, is exceptional, and has rightly been read as such: in fact, it sits in an almost twenty-year period from 1969 to 1989 in which Prynne used no other dedications at all. (Prynne, 'Es Lebe der König', in *Poems*, pp. 169--70. Mellors describes it as 'the central poem in *Brass*', implying a certain divergence through centrality [p. 188].) *Word Order* (1989) is dedicated to an unidentified 'J.P.', who may be Prynne's daughter, but it is not until the 1990s that clear dedications to poets reappear: *Not-You* (1993) is dedicated to 'Che Qian-zi and Zhou Ya-ping | and [...] the ORIGINALS', a group of Chinese poets, while the 1999 Bloodaxe edition of *Poems* is dedicated to Prynne's French translator, Bernard Dubourg. None of the poets mentioned above wrote or writes in English; in fact, Prynne's first dedication to a poet who wrote in English---if not an English poet---does not come until 2005, fully fifty years after the beginning of his poetic career, with the offering of the second Bloodaxe edition of *Poems* to Ed Dorn, who died in 1999.]

Making use of such material for the purposes of biographical analysis allows Prynne to be reinserted into a broad, 20th-century literary tradition from which he is too often excluded, both by his supporters and by his detractors. Once the critical lens is focussed properly, Prynne's position in this tradition is not at all difficult to see, emerging in areas as seemingly banal as his professional name. As Terry Eagleton notes in a recent review of D.J. Taylor's *The Prose Factory*,

> [t]he Victorians did not generally call themselves by the initials of their first two names plus their surname [...] and neither do most authors from roughly the second half of the 20th century onwards. [...] Between these two periods, however, this largely male habit of self-designation spreads thick and fast: H.G., T.S., W.B., E.M., D.H., L.P., W.H. and so on.'^[Terry Eagleton, 'A Toast at the Trocadero', *London Review of Books*, 38.4 (18 February 2016), 9--10 (p. 10).]   

\noindent That Prynne's adoption of the style is a deliberate choice rather than a reversion to default is shown, paradoxically, by the indecision with which it is made. Prynne's first published poem, in the 1955 sixth-form magazine *Six*, is credited to 'J.H.', yet as late as *Prospect* 6, two years after the publication of *Force of Circumstance* (also 'J.H.'), he is listed as 'Jeremy'. The style would of course have been familiar from institutional contexts: the Jesus College yearbooks for the period of Prynne's undergraduate course consistently initialise names, as do some military records. Prynne's entirely optional decision to adopt it for literary purposes, however, signals a claim to occupy a certain tradition, the more so as the style had clearly gone out of fashion by the 1960s---in contemporary magazines, Prynne's is often the only initialised name on the contents page, and in circulation lists for *The English Intelligencer* he is accompanied only by his college friend R.F. Langley.^[Notices, in *Certain Prose*, 1:11 [173], pp. 24--25; 'Roll Call', in *ibid*., 1:15 [266], pp. 78--79.]  In Prynne's case, that tradition might owe as much to, say, R.P. Blackmur, the American poet and critic cited in 'Resistance and Difficulty', as it does to T.S. Eliot or even F.R. Leavis. Nevertheless, it *is* a tradition, one which is both eminently mainstream and---at least for Prynne in the 1950s and early '60s---relatively recent. A similar reversion to tradition can be seen in what is apparently Prynne's clearest rejection of it; namely, his enthusiastic suppression of *Force of Circumstance*. While Prynne's symbolic repudiation of the poetic technique of his debut collection is avant-garde in content, leading to the stylistic innovation of his later work, it is totally conventional in form. Its two clearest forbears are Charles Tomlinson's suppression of his own debut pamphlet, *Relations and Contraries*, and W.H. Auden's obsessive exclusion of early poems---notably 'Spain'---from collected editions during his lifetime.

Discussions of Prynne's influences are frequently divided along lines of will, choice or intention. On the one hand, he is presented---to some extent correctly---as a sort of polymath, evincing a deep knowledge both of the literary matters that constitute his immediate field of professional expertise and of a surprisingly disparate range of other subjects, including the technical and the scientific. This is a level of influence which might be described as self-directed, and whose already considerable scope seems to expand with every new reading of Prynne's work. When poetic influence in the more diffuse, environmental sense is discussed, however, Prynne appears as the product of a highly restricted field: Ezra Pound, Charles Olson, Ed Dorn and perhaps two or three more canonical poets such as Wordsworth are the only figures regularly acknowledged as major influences on Prynne's mature work, despite his evidently close and prolonged reading of scores of other poets, both in English and in other languages. Even in the case of the poets mentioned above, influence is often presented as something directed by Prynne: dissatisfied with the moribund state of English poetry in the late 1950s, he sought out new work from across the Atlantic. This thesis has made the implicit case for a new category of influences situated chronologically in the period 1955--75 and geographically in Britain. These influences differ from one another not only in content, but also structurally, and can be summarised as follows.

The first is the literary and literary-critical culture represented by the poetry of the Movement and the criticism of F.R. Leavis, as well as their respective and mutual offshoots, considered in Chapter 1. Absorbed pedagogically and institutionally through the relatively homogeneous environments of the 1950s public school and Cambridge college, these influences accordingly emerge in the most pedagogical and institutional aspects of Prynne's life and work: the early lecture text on Victorian poetry, for example, or his much later notes for English students at Caius. The broadest of the three fields of influence examined in this thesis, it is also the most conventional, both in its cultural prominence and in its mode of operation. The second is the British side of the avant-garde little magazine scene towards which Prynne turned in the early 1960s, as described in Chapter 2. While apparently deliberate, this turn loses some of its force when the lack of any 'third way' for publication and distribution is considered, Prynne having by this point decisively rejected the mainstream channels offered by a figure like Donald Davie. Unlike the form of influence described in the previous chapter, in which specific critical attitudes or tenets are either adopted or negated, this *milieu* makes its influence felt structurally, as the material context in which Prynne's thought takes place. Accordingly, its effect is more like a negative imprint: its trace appears at the very moment that Prynne attempts to reach beyond it, most obviously in his letter to Peter Riley of 15 September 1967 and in the prose piece 'A Note on Metal'. The third and final field of influence explored in this thesis is more diffuse, being represented by the fiction of Wyndham Lewis, Edward Upward and Douglas Oliver, discussed alongside a number of other points of reference---notably the scientific work of Francis Crick and Joseph Needham---in Chapter 3. In this case, the process is a combination of the previous two: Prynne does not merely adopt elements of these writers' work in his own prose, nor does he simply write against or around them. Rather, certain works by Prynne, Lewis, Upward and Oliver form part of a broader nexus of conscious and unconscious concerns which comes into focus when they are read together. This nexus is comprised primarily of issues about national identity, sexual maturity and reproduction.

Beyond the localised concept of the 'good scientist', the nexus formed by these concerns has not yet been given a name. By way of conclusion, this thesis will suggest one such name: fatherhood. From the implantation and nurturing of a literary sensibility in the mind of a child to the creation of the autonomous, resistant poem, and even to the 'seeding' of Earth itself, the structure of heterosexual reproduction and child-rearing (as seen from the father's perspective) seems to sit behind much of what matters most deeply to the Prynne that emerges in the foregoing pages. Ironically, this conclusion has been reached through a mode of analysis that has striven precisely to avoid the most common---and arguably the least illuminating---deployment of the fatherhood metaphor in literary studies, namely the semi-Freudian model of poetic inheritance set out in Harold Bloom's *The Anxiety of Influence* (1973). This thesis's focus on the context of Prynne's early career has of course reinforced a masculine approach to his work, insofar as his educational, professional and even literary surroundings in the 1950s, '60s and '70s were overwhelingly male-dominated.^[Not atypically for a person of his sex, generation and class, Prynne attended all-boys prep and day schools before undertaking National Service. This was followed immediately by an undergraduate degree, graduate work and employment at all-male colleges (Caius did not admit female students or fellows until as late as 1979) and publication in male-dominated little magazines.]  Even so, its contention has been that Prynne's aesthetic, intellectual and ethical stance is the product of an exceptionally diverse (though differentially weighted) pool of influences, which certainly cannot be reduced to the patrilineal Pound--Olson--Prynne structure presented in works such as Mellors's *Late Modernist Poetics*.^[This is not to suggest that Mellors thinks that it can; his book is one study of a particular aspect of these poets' work.]  Andrea Brady is right to point out that such models risk becoming 'fantasies of all-male reproduction', particularly when extended into the present.^[Brady, p. 245.]  Yet, in what is perhaps itself a Freudian structure, avoidance in this thesis of the concept of fatherhood when discussing external influence has caused (or at least allowed) it to emerge in the interpretation of the internals of Prynne's thought.

It is important to insist that any unconscious concern with fatherhood in Prynne's prose and correspondence coexists with a fully conscious and highly critical attention to the nuclear family in his poetry, at least from *Brass* onwards. One of the clearest examples is 'The Bee Target on his Shoulder', the opening poem of *Brass*, which deals directly with the figure of the father, using the word itself four times.^[Prynne, 'The Bee Target on his Shoulder', in *Poems*, pp. 150--52.]  In this complex poem, the father is presented as a lurid and arbitrary figure, simultaneously dangerous and ridiculous. First appearing as someone who 'command[s]' (l. 7), his imperatives soon turn against him---'Do not love this man. He makes | Fridays unbearable' (13)---only to double back in the poem's third act: 'Love him' (84).^[As Ryan Dobran points out, 'Do not love this man' is a direct negation of a phrase from Olson's 'The Distances': 'Love this man' (Dobran, 'The Difficult Style', p. 138; Olson, 'The Distances', in *The Collected Poems of Charles Olson*, ed. by George F. Butterick [Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1987], pp. 491--92).]  The specifically English oppressiveness of enforced family gatherings---'*that's* his | aunt with the brown teapot jammed | into edible, macerated crumpet' (28--30)---is shown in its proper relation to real violence: 'Together we love him limb from | limb' (50--51). According to Matthew Hall,

> [t]he position accentuated in the poem is the representation of the body politic of the familial unit, depicted as 'a circle of teeth by the cosy fire.' [120] The family collectively forms an estranged mouth which ventriloquises its consumptive patterns and its own wounded utterances, creating song from the shadow cast by loss.^[Hall, p. 43.]

\noindent As Sutherland notes, 'The Bee Target on his Shoulder' is saturated with bathos: 'moments of outright bathetic interruption in this poem [...] are disruptive only if we permit ourselves to ignore the differently modulated bathos of the lines that they appear to interrupt'.^[Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 215.]  Thus, in the poem's final stages, an overbearingly sentimental example of what Mellors describes as 'bogus quotation'---'little | sister we sob merrily & settle down | by the newest grave' (112--14)---shows up the equally false and conventional nature of what has gone before, visible most obviously in the dropping of the possessive pronoun 'her': 'Bravely she traces | the path of father's boots | on the lawn'.^[Mellors, p. 181.]  The pseudo-Victorianism of this passage---its concern with small children and death, for example---raises through implication the most oppressive and emotionally tyrannical aspects of traditional fatherhood. Yet, far from proving the critical nature of all of Prynne's engagements with fatherhood and the family, the vigilant skepticism of poems such as 'The Bee Target on his Shoulder' makes any uncritical or unwitting adoption of these structures elsewhere in his *oeuvre* all the more significant. Prynne is not a credulous consumer of bourgeois ideology; rather, that ideology is so pervasive that it shapes the thinking of even the most rigorously critical subject.

The *ur*-father provided for Prynne by Mellors is Ezra Pound, a poet who, it was claimed at the beginning of this thesis, would 'haunt every one of the following chapters'.^[*Cf*. p. 10.]  A characteristic example is Prynne's use of the term 'ego scriptor' above, a phrase which raises the spectre of Pound---subject of multiple popular and scholarly biographies, including David Moody's three-volume, 1,650-page *Ezra Pound: Poet*---at the very moment that he attempts to thwart biographical interest in his own work.^[A. David Moody, *Ezra Pound: Poet: A Portrait of the Man and His Work*, 3 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009--15). For Pound's use of the phrase, see Pound, 'XXIV', in *The Cantos of Ezra Pound* (New York: New Directions, 1996), 110--14 (p. 112) and 'LXII', in *ibid*., 341--50 (p. 350).]  What, then, is the structure of this 'haunting', and what does it say about that which it affects? Like Prynne, Pound is a poet concerned at a deep level with problems of reproduction: one of the crucial charges against 'usura' in Canto XLV, arguably the centre-piece of the long poem that represents Pound's lifework, is that it 'slayeth the child in the womb'.^[Pound, 'XLV', in *ibid*., 229--30 (p. 230).]  Pound is, however, much more ready than Prynne to acknowledge direct poetic influence.^[This is not to suggest that Prynne is in any sense unaware of issues of poetic fatherhood and influence: self-conscious tics in his correspondence, such as referring to Donald Davie by his initials (D.A.D.), show that he is very much aware of them. Nor is it to suggest that Prynne is lax in his acknowledgement of source material in general, a notion dispelled by poems as diverse as 'The Glacial Question, Unsolved' and *Kazoo Dreamboats*. The point, as noted above in relation to dedications, is that he does not go out of his way to acknowledge specifically poetic influence, e.g. in matters of style, even in periods when his style has been recongisably derivative of, say, Olson or Tomlinson.]  The most famous example of such acknowledgement is the early poem 'A Pact', a short piece in which Pound explicitly positions himself in filial relationship to Walt Whitman: 'I come to you as a grown child | Who has had a pig-headed father; | I am old enough now to make friends.' Pound presents his task as one of refinement: 'It was you that broke the new wood, | Now is a time for carving.'^[First appearing in *Poetry* (April 1913), pp. 11--12, the poem was accompanied on its second page by 'In a Station of the Metro', a piece whose 'wet, black bough' constitutes a direct development of the 'new wood' that 'A Pact' attributes to Whitman.]  Prynne's *oeuvre* contains no such direct statement of influence. Yet, as was pointed out at the beginning of this thesis, the intellectual and contextual correspondences between Pound and Prynne are numerous, and arguably more compelling than any equivalent similarities with, say, Olson or Dorn. In particular, the blistering scorn of Prynne's private and semi-private tirades against poetic stupidity---matched only by the intellectual, social and even financial generosity of his attempts to support and promote those writers whose work he has considered important---is a characteristic which cannot but be linked to the author of 'How to Read'.

If Pound is to be considered a poetic 'father' to Prynne, it is in precisely the sense identified above: a relationship characterised by distance, like that of the good scientist and his creation, but which can also, with effort, be read backwards. The apparent conflict between the disparate influences identified in this thesis and grand theories of patrilineal poetic descent might therefore be dispelled by seeing Pound and his career as a sort of over-arching formal influence within which more local influences (Davie, Tomlinson, Leavis) emerge as content: an image of the father as a matryoshka doll containing a set of successively shrinking sub-fathers.^[Pound is perhaps even akin to the symbolic father described by Jacques Lacan, whose 'true function [...] is fundamentally to unite (and not to set in opposition) a desire and the Law' (Jacques Lacan, *Écrits: A Selection*, trans. by Alan Sheridan [London: Tavistock Publicatons, 1977], p. 321).]  The apparent genealogical absolutism of this perspective is tempered if Pound---and Prynne's relationship to him---is understood as one formal structure among many. Thus, a thesis which took Olson rather than Pound as its implicit starting point may have come up with a quite different set of emphases and influences, even where these influences have only a formal or structural rather than a direct relation to Olson himself. It is important to acknowledge such underlying structures, even and especially when they emerge into view at the end of a process of argumentation which they have helped to generate. Through reflection on the concept as a crystallisation of the material that it produces (and that produces it), that material can be viewed from a bird's-eye perspective structurally impossible in the analysis itself.

In the present case, the fact that a particularly patrilineal, Poundian air emerges from a consideration of Prynne's early career has the potential to shed further light on the periodisation of his work. Would the selection of a period other than 1955--75 for contextual analysis---say, the period from the publication of *Poems* in 1982 to Prynne's retirement from academic life in 2005---have necessitated a different structuring force? What is obscured by the structure that has emerged? The type of poetic inheritance which it is possible to extrapolate from the good scientist trope is, for one thing, entirely androcentric: descent is based structurally on the male side of the reproductive process, with almost no regard for the female.^[An obvious example of such disregard is Prynne's discussion of Shelley and Malthus in relation to contemporary reproductive policy, in which women are viewed as mechanical functions in a bio-economic system regulated primarily by male legislators. While a charitable interpretation would claim that it is precisely this system which Prynne is arguing *against*, it is nevertheless the case that the argument takes place within a material intellectual context---*The English Intelligencer*---which is only marginally less male-dominated than the 44th Parliament itself. As mentioned in Chapter 2, the proportion of recipients of *The English Intelligencer* who were women was, at the height of its admittedly limited circulation, less than seven per cent. The equivalent rate for female MPs after the 1966 election was approximately four per cent ('Women MPs & parliamentary candidates since 1945', *UK Political Info*, \<http://www.ukpolitical.info/FemaleMPs.htm\> [accessed 2 February 2016]). In any case, few of the female recipients of the *Intelligencer* participated actively in its discussions.]  Any conception of poetic creation based even metaphorically on a 'natural' view of sexual reproduction is also heteronormative. To raise these issues is not simply to nitpick from a more enlightened cultural-historical position. It is not clear that poets' thinking about poetry can be placed on an ever-advancing political timeline, and even if it could it is not obvious that any advance which would afford the contemporary critic a privileged vantage point has in fact taken place. What is clear is that androcentrism and heteronormativity are recognisable parts of Prynne's thinking about aesthetic practice in this period---broadly encapsulated in the good scientist trope described at the end of Chapter 3---rather than unfortunate aberrations to be explained away. To put it plainly, when in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s Prynne refers to 'the poet', this idealised figure is more or less implicitly a heterosexual man.

![Appearances of 'man' per 1,000 lines in *Force of Circumstance* (1962) and *Poems* (2005)](figs/man.png){#fig:man}

The chronological qualifier in the last sentence is necessary, and---if a poet's thinking about poetry can be assumed to leave a trace in the work itself---the restriction it imposes is to some extent backed up by statistics. Figure @fig:man shows the results of analysing concatenated scanned texts of *Force of Circumstance* and the 2005 edition of *Poems* according to a very crude approximation of androcentricity: appearances of the word 'man'---used either as a singular noun or to refer to 'mankind'---per 1,000 lines. A clear trend is visible, consisting of a spike around the beginning of *The White Stones* (l. 1,800) and a steady drop-off thereafter.^[The usage of similar terms such as 'human' or 'woman' across the text does not show any comparable trend. While the text used may be subject to scanning errors, these should be approximately randomly distributed and would therefore not affect the shape of the chart.]  For reference, the chronological scope of this thesis terminates with *High Pink on Chrome* (1975) at around l. 8,350. Such analysis violently flattens the semantic complexity of Prynne's work---it is impossible to tell whether any given usage of 'man' is sincere, ironic, direct, reported, and so on---but offers a sort of knowledge which can only be gained through such flattening, rather than through readily disputable readings of individual usages. While it would be foolish, then, to use Figure @fig:man as evidence of the androcentricity of Prynne's early work, if that quality is established by other means then the diagram can be used to trace its probable contours.^[Without claiming it as 'seal of approval' for the statistical approach, it is interesting to note that Prynne himself has made use of similar analyses: discussing his compositional process in 2014, he described checking words against a digital text of his collected poems to review past usages (Prynne, 'A Dialogue with Nicholas Royle').]

Writing to Douglas Oliver in 1994 on the subject of intellectual and ethical consistency, Prynne claims that 'it is not facile to speak of ethical style, and to recognise that even within a single lifetime there is room for many shifts which can nonetheless preserve a thread of purposeful mutation.'^[Prynne to Oliver, 5 September 1994.]  This implicitly genetic model, in which the subject is neither absolutely changeable nor absolutely consistent, is perhaps helpful in coming to terms with Prynne's own evolving opinions. For his part, Prynne is well aware of changes in his own thinking and practice, acknowledging later in the same letter that 'my own habit now is sharply altered from only a few years back.' In the recent lecture-essay 'The Poet's Imaginary', which presents a conception of poetic composition as involving a sort of introjected double-self, Prynne tackles the relation between poetry and gender directly:

> the dyadic relation of poet and imaginary [...] may not be accompanied by determined gender assignments. Either figure may be male or female, or may include features of both, like a system of Christian angels who, rather than owning no sexual identity at all, may present as equally responsive to both genders and both bodily incarnations, in cherishment and in trust.^[Prynne, 'The Poet's Imaginary', p. 104.]

That this statement might now be objected to for its binarism---'both genders and both bodily incarnations'---illustrates how poetic thought exists in relation to an always-shifting social and historical context; a context from which, as Prynne would be the first to acknowledge, it does not have the luxury of severing itself. Earlier in 'The Poet's Imaginary', Prynne writes that 'being a good poet and continuing to meet the self-challenge of not lapsing into mediocrity is continuously difficult, a matter of struggle not easily handled because intrinsically hard to recognize accurately'.^[Prynne, 'The Poet's Imaginary', p. 96.]  Part of this difficulty---and something that Prynne has striven to do throughout his career---is to acknowledge the intersection of the poetic and the political, even when they appear to be most separate, and especially when the content of the latter is remote from the poet's own personal experience.

The poetical is personal and the personal is political. As long as literary analysis is restricted to the texts of individual poems and not extended to the persons who produce them, as well as to their non-poetic work, much of the historical marbling described by Falci---'History doesn't determine form, but a poem is nonetheless marbled by its context'---will remain obscure. This point is made not from the standpoint of a self-deluding common sense but from that of materialism: to confine historicist analysis to individual texts is an error in the same category as the formalist evacuation of context against which historicist criticism itself reacts. In one of his clearest statements of aesthetic principle, Prynne writes that 'no poet has or can have clean hands, because clean hands are themselves a fundamental contradiction. Clean hands do no worthwhile work.'^[Prynne, 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', p. 141.]  That his choice of metaphor is bodily neatly illustrates the point in question. Poems do not get written without hands, and those hands inevitably do other things, from eating hamburgers to filling in ballot papers. This is something, Prynne claims, that he 'ha[s] believed throughout [his] writing career'.^[*Ibid*.]  Scholars of Prynne's work owe it to the truth of the first quotation not to take that of the second on trust.
