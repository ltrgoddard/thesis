# Postscript

Two weeks prior to the submission date for this thesis, the *Paris Review* interview discussed in its Conclusion was published, constituting an 'edited fragment' of a 152,000-word transcript.^[Prynne, 'The Art of Poetry', p. 177.] The excerpt includes a substantial discussion of Prynne's early career, including his relationships with Donald Davie, Charles Tomlinson and Cid Corman, and validates many of the judgements made on the basis of archival evidence in the present text. Had the interview been published earlier, this thesis may have spent less time on the basic details of Prynne's early career, but it is hoped that it will serve as a useful companion text to the full interview when it becomes available. While individual observations from the *Paris Review* excerpt have been incorporated into this thesis where relevant, often as footnotes, no substantial attempt has been made to revise the text as a whole.
