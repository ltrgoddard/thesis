# 'The inter-modifying force of open argument' 


## i. Introduction

Periodicals have played a crucial role in the distribution both of Prynne's poetry and of his prose over the course of the last five decades. Yet the category 'periodical' is a broad one, stretching to encompass everything from photocopied 'zines' to academic journals, from national newspapers to the annual records of Oxford and Cambridge colleges. This chapter will focus on one specific form of periodical, the little magazine, examining Prynne's engagement with this form throughout his early career and attempting to overturn some conventional critical positions on this engagement. It will then go on to read one of Prynne's prose works, 'A Note on Metal', in detail, developing an argument about Prynne's relation to history. Chapter 1 concluded that, by virtue of his rejection of the machinery of mainstream poetic publicity in the mid- to late-1960s, Prynne is 'more properly Leavisian than most of the so-called Leavisites'; it will be the task of the present chapter to determine what this rejection means in practice. As in the discussion of Davie and Leavis, special attention will be paid to periodicals and points of contact which may have been overlooked in previous accounts, whether as a result of the bias towards transatlantic influence that has already been described or simply due to the lack of existing archival research on the very earliest stages of Prynne's career. Before developing any sort of argument, however, it will be necessary to provide a provisional definition of the little magazine. Long a neglected area of literary studies, little magazines have experienced renewed academic interest in recent years. The publication of David Miller and Richard Price's *British Poetry Magazines 1914--2000: A History and Bibliography of 'Little Magazines'* in 2006 coincided with the beginning of Peter Brooker and Andrew Thacker's Modernist Magazines Project, which has since resulted in an online archive of scanned journals and the publication of three substantial reference volumes covering magazines in Britain and Ireland, North America and continental Europe.^[*Modernist Magazines Project*, \<http://www.modernistmagazines.com/\> [accessed 15 January 2015]; Peter Brooker and Andrew Thacker, eds., *The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines, Volume 1 Britain and Ireland 1880--1955* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009); Brooker and Thacker, eds., *The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines, Volume II: North America 1894--1960* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012); Brooker, Thacker, Sascha Bru and Christian Weikop, eds., *The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines, Volume III: Europe 1880--1940* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).] These new resources come on top of a number of existing bibliographical and critical works, many of which are listed in Price's selected bibliography of little magazine scholarship.^[Richard Price, 'Little Magazines', *British Library*, \<http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/journals/littlemagazines/littlemagazines.html\> [accessed 15 January 2015].] Nevertheless, there remain regions of obscurity. One such region is occupied by little magazines published in Britain from the 1960s onwards, which are excluded for reasons of chronology from Brooker and Thacker's 2009 volume. Miller and Price's largely bibliographical work on these periodicals supplements valuable oral history undertaken by Wolfgang Görtschacher, notably in his *Little Magazine Profiles: The Little Magazines in Great Britain, 1939--1993* (1993); nevertheless, that one of the key resources in the field remains a Ph.D. project produced by an Austrian scholar more than two decades ago is itself suggestive of the lack of critical attention to these magazines in Britain. Given the dates of Prynne's poetic activity, this is clearly problematic for any scholar of his work.

For the purposes of this chapter, the little magazine is understood to be a periodical concerned primarily with literature (generally poetry), produced cheaply by volunteers formally independent of any external institution and distributed for a short period of time to a small group of subscribers, either for free or for a small fee.^[The relationship between little magazine producers and external institutions is described as only 'formally independent' in order to acknowledge the many forms of informal institutional support that exist. This is clearest in the case of magazines produced by members of universities, who may enjoy privileged access to means of physical production such as printers and photocopiers---or, in earlier periods, mimeograph machines---in arrangements which are contingent on their academic status and seniority.] Production costs, pricing, length of operation and subscriber numbers are all relative terms and it would be futile to impose any absolute upper limit on any of them; nevertheless, their consistent minimisation across the field of little magazine production points to a single determinant, which can be identified as non-commerciality. Any little magazine which is sold for a fee may, strictly speaking, be considered a commodity. Nevertheless, it is a relatively consistent feature of little magazines that they strive constantly to escape the commodity form, either by being given away for free or, if this is not financially viable, by minimising the proportion of surplus value returned to their producers after sale (a proportion which, in any case, rarely exceeds the amount necessary to produce the next issue of the magazine). Contributions to the running of a little magazine often take the form of relatively unmediated provision of the materials for production and distribution, e.g. the use of a mimeograph machine or a book of postage stamps. As a result of this dislocation from the world of commercial publishing, little magazines of the type with which this chapter is concerned rarely carry advertising, though there are exceptions to this rule, notably *Prospect*. These criteria constitute a rough practical or economic definition of the little magazine. There is, however, a further, ideological level to consider before the concept will come fully into focus. Little magazines have historically been associated with modernism; specifically, with the long canonical period of Euro-American modernism extending roughly from the beginning of the First World War to the end of the Second. As such, the attempt to define the little magazine in the 1960s and '70s encounters many of the problems inherent in defining 'late modernism', a term which is frequently applied to Prynne's work---including on the dustjacket of his collected poems---but rarely in a critical or self-reflexive fashion.

The most detailed study of the term in specific relation to Prynne is provided by Anthony Mellors's *Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne* (2005), a work whose subtitle suggests the broad outline of its argument: that the 'impersonality, eclecticism, linguistic playfulness and Hermetic rigour' of Prynne's poetry descends in a linear fashion from the work of Ezra Pound, via that of Charles Olson, and that the whole phenomenon can be described as late modernist in character.^[Anthony Mellors, *Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne* (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2005), p. 118.] Yet Mellors also provides an external, logistical definition of the category to complement this narrative of internal aesthetic development. Introducing the section of the book which concerns Prynne, he notes that '[t]he real and imaginary divisions between modernist and anti-modernist camps run very deep in British literary culture and have only recently begun to seem archaic':

> While in the final analysis the distinction between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' poetry is bogus, the view taken by the institutions and prize-giving bodies that have evolved since the 1950s has been one of pull-quote respect for the great modernists accompanied by unwavering contempt for 'foreign' experiments carried out by British poets.^[*Ibid*.]

It is this characteristically late-20th century separation---an intellectually 'bogus' distinction which has taken on the character of reality through the sheer fact of continued enforcement---with which this chapter is partly concerned, accepting the essential arbitrariness of the disjunction while investigating the real effects that it has exerted, particularly on the work grouped under the 'alternative' side of the equation.^[This structure bears some similarity to what Simon Jarvis, in his work on Theodor Adorno, terms a 'real illusion': 'that is [...] an illusion which cannot be dispelled simply by recognising it as such' (Simon Jarvis, *Adorno: A Critical Introduction* [Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998], p. 68).] Mellors goes on to link this situation directly to the non-commerciality of small presses and little magazines: 'While the small press might not be entirely free from the process of exchange, it nevertheless represents an alternative to the market-led interests of established publishing houses.'^[Mellors, p. 119.] Reading 'little magazine' for 'small press', we can thus clarify the definition of the late modernist little magazine in Britain as one which exists in a specifically antagonistic relationship to mainstream poetry publishing: not so much non-commercial, then, as *anti*-commercial, rejecting exchange---if not fully, then as far as possible---as part of a deliberate strategy of contestation. Crucially, Mellors presents Prynne's involvement with these magazines as equally deliberate, rather than simply as the result of his exclusion from other channels: 'Where other poets hoped to work their way up from little magazines and presses to gain greater recognition with Faber, Cape, Oxford University Press, and other major publishers, Prynne reversed the process, placing higher value on small-scale enterprises.'^[*Ibid*., p. 220.] The signs of this deliberate effort at reversal are visible as early as 1963, when in a letter to Ed Dorn Prynne recounts a conversation with his Caius colleague, the biologist Francis Crick. Prynne is pleasantly surprised by Crick's familiarity with new developments in American poetry, but relays a reservation: 'what he did see as less obviously helpful in the long run was the positive *need* for social & cultural resistance, since while it functioned as a means of enhancing the concentration of effort and serious practice, it also encouraged a defensiveness and stridency of tone which tended to shatter the firm centre.' Having followed this train of thought, however---'if the reaction to resistance (real or imagined) distorts the shape of the utterance, then this is the poet's responsibility, for not having stepped into a wider & more open space'---his concluding question sounds a note of hesitation: 'what happens when this resistance---the necessity of marginal status within the overall context---disappears from the scene (Ph.D. theses and big publishers): will this operate as a liberation or as a more desperate extremity?'^[Prynne to Dorn, 22 January 1963.] Though the grammar of this sentence ('when', 'will') appears to present mainstream publication and academic recognition as inevitabilities, the very fact that it is asked seems to hold open the prospect of continued resistance.^[It is also worth questioning Prynne's elision of these two markers of conventional poetic success: as the course of his own later career suggests, 'Ph.D. theses' do not always go hand-in-hand with recognition by the 'big publishers'.]

The clearest way to represent Prynne's overall involvement with little magazines is visually. Figure 1 maps almost every periodical in which Prynne's poetic work has been published, linking them to the books in which the same work was subsequently collected.^[Poems that have never been printed as standalone books or pamphlets, such as 'The Land of Saint Martin' and 'Refuse Collection', have been excluded along with the periodicals in which they were originally published.] One of the principal uses of this mode of visualisation is as a tool to investigate the periodisation of Prynne's poetry, discussed at the beginning of the previous chapter. For example, the severing of *Force of Circumstance* from Prynne's later work is apparently confirmed by the lack of connections between the five publications in which its poems appeared---*Lyrische Hefte*, *Prospect*, *Satis*, *Mica* and *Tomorrow*---and subsequent collections of the 1960s such as *Kitchen Poems* and *The White Stones*. On the other hand, the status of the supposed second break between *The White Stones* and *Brass*---or, alternatively, somewhere in the middle of *The White Stones*---is altogether less clear: whatever its aesthetic ruptures, Prynne's poetry from the late 1960s to the mid-'70s seems to be bound together by a relatively coherent web of periodical publication. To take one more example, the books proposed by Keston Sutherland as representative of Prynne's 'late style'---'from *Red D Gypsum*, published in 1998, to the latest, *Kazoo Dreamboats*, from 2011'---are conspicuous by their absence from the diagram, suggesting a sort of negative coherence in independence.^[Sutherland, 'Introduction: "Prynne's late work?"', in *Hix Eros: On the Late Poetry of J.H. Prynne*, 9--13 (p. 11).] Despite their usefulness, it is important not to view diagrams such as Figure 1 as absolute standards against which the truth or falsity of various periodisation schemes can be measured; rather, they should be treated as individual elements in a broader mosaic of information. This is particularly the case when it comes to an object of study such as Prynne's career, which, as it is one of the key aims of this thesis to emphasise, cannot simply be reduced to a series of chapbooks or to the large yellow volume of the collected poems. Indeed, when prose is considered alongside poetry, some of the structures outlined in Figure 1 begin to break down: where, for instance, does 'Tomorrow is Fade Out Night' fit, being a review of Douglas Woolf's novel *Fade Out* (1959) printed in *Prospect* in 1964, well after Prynne had repudiated his poetic style in *Force of Circumstance* but before the shift had been confirmed by the publication of *Kitchen Poems*?^[Prynne, 'Tomorrow is Fade Out Night', *Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), pp. 41--43.] In order to flesh out the skeleton represented by Figure 1, it will be necessary to provide a brief historical overview of Prynne's relationships with little magazines from as early as the 1950s, before moving to consider issues of influence and continuity from a more focused perspective, 'zooming in' on the magazines *Mica* and *Satis*. Given the restriction of the scope of this thesis to Prynne's early career and the significant work that has already been done on his involvement with *The English Intelligencer*, this account will concentrate primarily on the period from 1955 to the first issue of the *Intelligencer* in 1966.^[The most comprehensive account of the *Intelligencer* is provided by Latter; a much more concise introduction is offered in Neil Pattison, 'Introduction: "All Flags Left Outside"', in *Certain Prose*, pp. i--xxiv and 'Editorial Notes', in *ibid*., pp. xxv--xxxii.]

## ii. Early engagements, 1955--66

Prynne's involvement with little magazines begins as early as his time in the sixth form at St Dunstan's College, where in 1955 he was instrumental in the revival of a school publication, *Six*, which had last appeared in 1948. Billed as 'an unofficial production undertaken by members of the Sixth Form', *Six*'s 1955 issue was edited by Prynne, and it therefore seems fair to assume that its brief, unsigned editorial statement was also written by him.^[Susan Brown, email to the author, 9 October 2013. Some sense of what producing a sixth form magazine at a minor public or grammar school in this period actually involved is provided by Prynne's near-contemporary Ian Hamilton in Dan Jacobson, 'You Muddy Fools' (interview with Ian Hamilton), *London Review of Books*, 24.2 (14 January 2002), pp. 3--14.] This statement is conspicuous in its desire to place the issue within a long-running tradition, or at least one that might seem long-running to a sixth-former. According to the school's archivist, the magazine had 'appeared sporadically from the 1930s' onwards, a run which the eighteen- or nineteen-year-old Prynne describes as 'almost legendary'.^[*Ibid*.; Prynne, editorial statement, *Six* (1955), [unpaginated].] He then proceeds to generalise about previous editions of *Six*---particularly those produced during the Second World War---claiming that '[a] generation stands mirrored in [their] pages':

> it may not perhaps be too rash to detect in comparison with [the present issue's] forbears, a paradoxically more balanced and less adult approach to life. The accelerated maturity forced on the war generation has gradually relaxed its grip; and the recondite earnestness and cynical obscurantism of the war-time SIX's rings slightly strange to a generation which has never been forced face to face with the bitter futility of war.

The point of this comparison might seem to be to distance the 1955 cohort from their wartime equivalents, men of Donald Davie's generation who would by this point have been well on their way to positions of adult authority, some perhaps serving as schoolmasters. Yet there is also, in the easy use of the term 'forbears', a deliberate claim to continuity---indeed, the very act of making the comparison implies that there is something comparable. Prynne strengthens the sense of tradition by going on describe his English master, Basil Harvey, as 'the spiritual god-father of SIX ever since its first appearance', before expressing hope that the revived magazine 'will not die an early death [...] will not sink back into oblivion.' The 1955 issue itself is a striking object. Between quarto and octavo in size, the issue's content is mimeographed from typewritten stencils, while the front cover is reminiscent of the July 1915 'war number' of *Blast*, featuring a large, capitalized title above a bold monochromatic print. The latter shows a delta-wing jet aircraft similar to early designs for the Avro Vulcan, seemingly balancing on its nose in front of a Greek temple, from the base of which emanate stylized rays of the sort featured on the Japanese Rising Sun Flag. When viewed next to this print, the issue's Italian inscription, '*sesta forma giornale*' ['sixth form journal'], perhaps suggests an attempt to situate the magazine in a Futurist context, though stray words in Russian and Greek raise the possibility of a more prosaic adolescent cleverness. Linguistic facility is evident in the issue's content, too: of the 13 poems and prose pieces that make up the magazine, two are in French and two in German, including Prynne's own contribution, a translation into German of Thomas Hood's Petrarchan sonnet 'Silence'.^[Prynne, 'Stille (nach Thomas Hood)', *Six* (1955), p. 11. The poem is credited to 'J.H.' rather than 'Jeremy' Prynne, following a consistent form for all contributors, and perhaps representing the origin of the initialization that Prynne would adopt for almost all of his subsequent poetic work.]

The magazines to which Prynne contributed as an undergraduate and postgraduate student are relatively few, but are nevertheless instructive in their variety. In 1960, Prynne had two poems published in little magazines: 'Times Trans-shifting: for Robert Herrick', which appeared in *Prospect*, and 'The Hazel Tree', which was printed in *Tomorrow*.^[Prynne, 'Times Trans-shifting: for Robert Herrick', *Prospect*, 4 (Winter 1960), p. 14; Prynne, 'The Hazel Tree', *Tomorrow*, 4 (1960), p. 15.] Both founded in 1959, *Prospect* and *Tomorrow* are in many ways mirror images of each other, with the axis of reflection situated somewhere along the newly-opened M1 motorway: the former was edited by Elaine Feinstein, Tony Ward and eventually Prynne himself in Cambridge, the latter by Ian Hamilton and Susil Pieris in Oxford.^[For brief accounts of the magazines by their primary editors, see Elaine Feinstein, 'Remembering Prospect', *Cambridge Literary Review*, 1.1 (Michaelmas 2010), pp. 141--47 and Jacobson.] Both had reached their fourth issue by the second half of 1960, each publishing a relatively broad range of more or less established poets, though with almost no actual overlap---aside from Prynne, the only contributor shared by the two magazines is Harold Pinter. This may testify to the relative insularity of the university communities which both *Tomorrow* and *Prospect* represent, or at least the importance of personal contact in the solicitation of work for publication, although both magazines also carried work by foreign poets, with *Prospect* becoming known for championing the new American poetry represented by Olson, Dorn and Robert Creeley, among others.^[The magazines' contents pages provide some incidental support for Blake Morrison's emphasis on a geographical bifurcation in the Movement: *Prospect* published Davie, *Tomorrow* Elizabeth Jennings and Roy Fuller, though the latter also printed poems by the Cambridge-educated D.J. Enright (Morrison, pp. 10--41).] The poems contributed by Prynne are characteristic of his work in *Force of Circumstance* and were subsequently reprinted on pp. 43 and 44 of that collection, suggesting a certain affinity between them. The former is a self-consciously metaphysical meditation on a phrase, 'lutes of amber', from Herrick's 'Upon Julia's Voice', which is printed on the facing page of the magazine. Prynne begins by bringing Herrick down to earth, questioning the efficacy of an instrument actually made from amber---'A sounding-board needs grain and temper, needs | A latent sympathy for vibrant tone'---yet goes on to transfer the deficiency to 'us':

> Their wood the essence of a former age,  
Their sound compacted in the golden glow  
Within their aromatic shapes, would seem  
Too rich, to us who never took our music  
Neat, but in smaller doses, over intervals.  

The lapsarian tone of the final three lines makes clear that the problem is on 'our' side of the equation: 'To contemplate a sound so rare, complete | Within its glowing moment: this would seem | Denied to us who have such need of time.' 'The Hazel Tree', by contrast, is more concerned with direct observation, though it also seems to set up an opposition between nature and the fallen state of modern man. Prynne describes a scene consisting of a hazel tree and a 'spike of bugle' (*Ajuga reptans*) in 'a shaded plain', using the homonymic character of 'bugle' to shift into musical terminology---'Shall I blow a note scored for trumpet | Set in the key of D major | With green ground-bass?'---and subsequently to military metaphor:

> From the battlements  
This may unlock, set loose  
The right response: officers are meant  
To be obeyed; fix bayonets,  
Senses quicken, without question  
Reflex action . . .^[It is worth remembering that this poem was published less than four years after Prynne had completed his two-year service as a National Service officer, and may have been written significantly earlier.]

This thought is undercut by the statement that 'there is always | The hazel tree; pause and reflect'. The purpose seems to be to counterpose human animation, represented by the bugle, to the tree's poise and stillness: 'Not impaled on action. | Pattern, not movement'. Later, the bugle is imagined as a 'stream | Of fluid discourse', its two colours forming an 'Interlinear gloss in two languages', before the refrain about the tree is repeated: 'there is always the hazel tree.'

If Prynne's very earliest poetic publications remained confined to the Oxbridge axis, 1961 saw him make contact with little magazines outside of the British academic *milieu* altogether: *Lyrische Hefte* and *Mica*. The former, edited by the German poet Arnfrid Astel, printed a single poem of Prynne's, 'Landfall', a phenomenological consideration of a bridge which seems to owe much to Martin Heidegger's 1951 essay 'Building Dwelling Thinking' ['*Bauen Wohnen Denken*']; this connection is doubly relevant given that one of the key points of reference for Heidegger's essay is the *Alte Brücke* in Heidelberg, the university town from which *Lyrische Hefte* was published.^[Prynne, 'Landfall', *Lyrische Hefte*, 10 (November 1961), p. 19. Though the essay, originally delivered as a lecture in Darmstadt in 1951, was not translated into English until two decades later (*Poetry, Language, Thought*, trans. by Alfred Hofstadter [New York: Harper and Row, 1971], pp. 145--161), it seems likely that Prynne would have encountered it in German. In the recent essay 'Huts', he recalls 'studying with great ardency' a 1950 edition of Heidegger's *Holzwege* (Prynne, 'Huts', p. 628).] In *Mica*, on the other hand, Prynne found a point of regular contact, with the American magazine publishing five poems and a letter between 1961 and '62---these contributions, as well as Prynne's involvement with the British magazine *Satis* in roughly the same period, will be considered in more detail in the following section. Prynne's prose piece 'Resistance and Difficulty' was published in *Prospect*'s fifth issue in 1961, while in 1963, having taken over the management of the latter publication himself and having been appointed fellow of Caius in the meantime, he wrote two reviews for the university periodical *The Cambridge Review*.^[Prynne, 'Resistance and Difficulty', *Prospect*, 5 (Winter 1961), pp. 26--30.] It is not entirely clear whether the *Review* conforms to the definition of the little magazine given in this chapter's introduction, being predominantly a university publication, though not one officially connected to or overseen by the university, and having a more general intellectual and academic than literary focus. Nevertheless, it provides an interesting point of comparison. *Force of Circumstance* had been reviewed in the magazine's pages in January 1963 by John Rathmell, Prynne's former coursemate at Jesus; the next month, Prynne contributed a review of the American poet Charles Edward Eaton's collection *Countermoves*, following this in March with an article on a recent anthology of German poetry in translation.^[J.C.A. Rathmell, 'Paradigms for a Wider Concern' (review of *Force of Circumstance*), *The Cambridge Review* (19 January 1963), pp. 193--94; Prynne, 'Figments of Reflection' (review of Charles Edward Eaton, *Countermoves*), *The Cambridge Review* (16 Feb 1963), pp. 281, 283; Prynne, '"Modernism" in German Poetry' (review of Michael Hamburger and Christopher Middleton, eds., *Modern German Poetry, 1910--1960*', *The Cambridge Review* (9 Mar 1963), pp. 331--33, 335, 337.] Despite this apparently auspicious start, however, Prynne did not become a regular contributor to the magazine; when he was commissioned to review Olson's *Maximus Poems IV, V, VI* (1968) six years later, a book which Prynne had himself had a hand in producing, alongside Robert Creeley's *For Love* (1962), the reviews were withdrawn after 'the Literary Editor allowed himself to be casually insulting about the modes involved.'^[Prynne to Riley, 25 February 1969. The Olson review was eventually printed in *The Park*, 4.5 (Summer 1969), pp. 64--66, while the Creeley review can be found in Box 19, Folder 327 of Ed Dorn's papers.] Describing the incident to Peter Riley, Prynne hints at his motives in writing for a relatively mainstream academic publication such as the *Review*: 'They [i.e. the reviews] were actually written directly at that benighted readership, so that now they're useless: I clearly should never have allowed myself to stumble into that maudlin and ignoble dependence, and I regret very much having done so.'^[*Ibid*.] Prynne seems to consider *The Cambridge Review* as something separate from the broader little magazine scene and his reviews for the publication as an educational service for 'benighted' readers not sufficiently clued-up about contemporary poetry. In an apparent reference to the informality of little magazine publication, Prynne celebrates the fact that '[w]hatever master-servant exploitations persist and exfoliate in the great world, we are not at last subject to the patronising imbecilities of *editors*'.^[*Ibid*.] Even so, it is clear that he maintains as rigorous a critical attitude towards little magazines as he does to other publications; in his previous letter to Riley, Prynne describes Andrew Crozier's magazine *The Park* (known as *The Wivenhoe Park Review* from 1965 to '68) as 'a rigidly passé disservice to our current needs', and the fact that the piece on Olson was eventually printed in the latter publication seems to put it on a par with *The Cambridge Review*.^[Prynne to Riley, 16 February 1969.]

As Ian Brinton points out, the gap between Prynne's assumption of the editorship of *Prospect* in the latter half of 1961 and the appearance of the magazine's sixth and final issue in Spring 1964 was a long one; yet as a result of Prynne's decision to include work by both Olson and Dorn in the issue, and his frequent correspondence with both, a detailed record of the period is available.^[Ian Brinton, 'Prynne in Prospect', *academia.edu*, \<https://www.academia.edu/6185230/Prynne\_in\_Prospect\> [accessed 21 January 2015].] Prynne's opening letters to the older poets, sent in November 1961, are both written on stationery stamped with a *Prospect* emblem and both focus primarily on soliciting work for publication. Writing to Olson, Prynne seems optimistic about the potential for the magazine to introduce new energy from North America to an apparently moribund English poetic scene: 'though the nature of this place makes it necessary to pretend that PROSPECT is respectable & harmless, I hope to print some genuine kinetics now and then, if not more often.'^[Prynne to Olson, 4 November 1961.] He follows this with further details about his hopes for Issue 6, complaining that '[y]ou can have no idea how hostile the parochial mediocrity of an English university can be' and revealing an intention to exclude prose contributions from the issue in order to give 'the wiseacres'---presumably a reference to reactionary dons of the sort whose disquisitions might be found in the pages of *The Cambridge Review*---'no foothold in prose theory.'^[Prynne to Olson, 26 November 1961.] In a short letter to Dorn the same month, Prynne reiterates this plan, requesting 'two or three shortish pieces, or one long piece' of poetry, though he is more cautious about *Prospect*'s potential to influence the local intellectual environment: 'No intention to make clamorous presentation of outrageous new American things [...]. I daren't, here in the middle of the most god-awful blasé city full of half-baked sophisticates, simply itching to patronise what they don't understand.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 29 November 1961. In his initial letter to Dorn, Prynne notes that *Prospect* is 'not out to shock like Tom Raworth's OUTBURST' (Prynne to Dorn, 16 November 1961).] Instead, he presents a deliberately gradualist approach: 'I care enough to keep our fragile magazine in print & circulation, to establish some kind of firm ground out from which we can then perhaps venture somewhat further. If I had cash & a private list like ORIGIN, then everything would be very different.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 29 November 1961.] The reference to Cid Corman's long-running magazine *Origin* (1951--84) reveals much about Prynne's hopes for Issue 6 of *Prospect* and beyond. Prynne had been in correspondence with Corman from June 1961 at the latest, while working as the Frank Knox Memorial Fellow at Harvard University, though the informal tone of his first letter suggests earlier contact.^[Prynne refers to Corman by his Christian name, whereas in his initial letters to Olson and Dorn he uses full names (Prynne to Corman, 17 June 1961).] Having taken over *Prospect*, he wrote to Corman almost immediately, requesting work from 'people you can't print in ORIGIN but would like to see started in England', asking Corman to put in good words for him with Olson, Dorn and Louis Zukofsky, and asking for general tips about the running of a little magazine. Perhaps most significantly, Prynne tentatively requests that Corman either send him the *Origin* subscriber list or print a notice advertising *Prospect* in a forthcoming issue of the magazine. Despite another reference to the 'special characteristics' of the 'English scene' and a desire not to see *Prospect* 'become simply another stamping ground for new American writers', the overall sense of this letter is that Prynne intends the magazine to become a sort of English *Origin*---not a carbon copy, but a publication that would take up the spirit of *Origin* and adapt it for audiences on the other side of the Atlantic.^[Prynne to Corman, 18 October 1961.] As he puts it in a subsequent letter to Corman, poets in Britain need to 'start again in ENGLISH, not your enviable US dialect, which our natives *must* draw from but could never *use*.'^[Prynne to Corman, 19 November 1961.]

In a brief note to Olson in February 1962, Prynne mentions delays to *Prospect* 6, but expresses hope that the issue will be published by April of the same year.^[Prynne to Olson, 14 February 1962.] Writing to Dorn in July, he describes how the magazine 'revealed unexpected teeth when I finally took it over, in the shape of a large bank overdraft' and claims to finally be on the verge of publication; by September, however, there are further delays, 'mainly through difficulties with funds'.^[Prynne to Dorn, 9 July 1962; Prynne to Dorn, 26 September 1962.] At this point there is a gap of almost seven months before the next mention of *Prospect*, in a February 1964 letter to Olson---here, Prynne claims that the magazine is 'due at the printers in ten days', though by June it has still not actually been distributed.^[Prynne to Olson, 1 February 1964; Prynne to Dorn, 30 June 1964.] What is most striking about this period---particularly given retrospective knowledge of the magazine's demise---is Prynne's optimism about *Prospect* as a continuing institution. Writing to Olson before Issue 6 has been published, he admits that 'I am now thinking already about the next *Prospect* after this one now on the stocks', suggesting that Issue 7 contain a long section of the *Maximus Poems*. Prynne is even optimistic about the Cambridge literary environment, claiming that 'things are beginning to happen here. There's now a range of subversive interest amongst students I'm in contact with, and I am hopeful of what will follow.'^[Prynne to Olson, 29 February 1964.] To Dorn, he reveals that Issue 6 will be given away for free, 'as I know from experience that any other way is squalid and makes no real financial difference.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 30 June 1964.] One of Prynne's clearest statements about his intentions for the continuation of the magazine in fact comes in an October 1964 letter to Robert Creeley, a facsimile of which is included in Dorn's papers; the statement is worth quoting in full:

> I don't want to spread [*Prospect*] around too easily, but to keep it an occasion of value, maybe in part as Cid managed with Origin. I shall have to find the expense myself, but that's better, in today's England, than mimicing the popular press, with ads and the glossy format. I hope, that way, there's something here, this side, to be brought out. It's not before time, anyway. I could wish that people here would want to have the sequence of them, could write for it and to each other, get clear of the middle class "society" idea and the caution which fogs everything at that level.^[Prynne to Robert Creeley, 21 October 1964.]

The tone of this statement is perhaps familiar from the previous chapter. Indeed, it is easy enough to imagine the Leavises expressing similar hopes for *Scrutiny* in the early 1930s, particularly the desire to transcend 'the middle class "society" idea'---the word 'society' appears more than 120 times, very often in a pejorative sense, in the two-volume *Selection from 'Scrutiny'*, rising to an average rate of twice a page in Q.D. Leavis's consideration of Edith Wharton.^[Q.D. Leavis, 'Henry James's Heiress: The Importance of Edith Wharton', in *A Selection from 'Scrutiny'*, vol. 2, pp. 124--36.] What is most important here, however, is the notion of community which seems to undergird Prynne's conception of the magazine. His hope is not just that recipients will write material for *Prospect*, but also that they will write 'to each other', perhaps unmediated by a correspondence page, as Prynne was at that very moment doing to Creeley. Yet the magazine will maintain a central, coordinating position within the social network that it is intended to generate: recipients will 'want to have the sequence of them', presumably in order to trace developments and conversations across issues, but also as a sort of monument.^[Writing to Peter Riley about the *Intelligencer* several years later, Prynne goes so far as to claim that 'I don't want a magazine myself, but rather [...] a series of well printed pamphlets, really nicely done [...]. Even small books in due course, but they *must* be conspicuously well done' (Prynne to Riley, 23 May 1967).] It is in this respect that Prynne's concern with the aesthetics of *Prospect* becomes especially relevant. Writing to Olson in March 1964, he notes that '[t]he format [for Issue 6] is quite large and it's to be fine, careful printing; I have a young design typographer who takes his tasks with alert zeal.'^[Prynne to Olson, 6 March 1964. While it is not entirely clear who is being referred to here, it is presumably not Rodney Dale, whose company Polyhedron had printed previous issues of the magazine and who is almost three years older than Prynne. Dale's xerography services are described in detail in a faux-Elizabethan advertisement on the back cover of *Prospect* 5: 'Master Rodney Dale wishes it to be known that he is to be found at the SIGN of the POLYHEDRON at 69, Histon Road, Cambridge', etc.] When Issue 6 finally emerged, its production note boasted that '[t]he text is set in 10 on 12 Plantin type with headings in 36 point Grotesque 126 and is printed on Conqueror blue white laid paper. End papers and wrappers are Swedish Tumba Ingrespapper.'^[*Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), [p. 45].] Perhaps the most significant decision made by Prynne was to jettison the advertisements which had crowded the pages of earlier issues, favouring instead a layout characterised by small text and plentiful white space. This move was part of the broader anti-commercial strain in the issue; according to Prynne's optimistic editorial statement, '[o]nly a very small number of copies will be for sale over a counter; but copies will be sent free of charge to any person who, out of a real sense of interest, thinks it worth writing to the editor to ask for them.'^[*Ibid*. Setting aside trivial examples such as the 1998 *Mays* anthology, *Six* and *Prospect* are the only ventures in relation to which Prynne has been listed unequivocally as 'the editor', despite his having exerted considerable editorial influence over *The English Intelligencer*. He is therefore able to assume a position of relative innocence when, as quoted above, he rails to Riley against 'the patronising imbecilities of *editors*' (Prynne to Riley, 25 February 1969).]

At this point, it is worth returning to the comparison between *Prospect* and *Origin* which is encouraged by Prynne's early contact with Corman. If there is a model for the editorial statement quoted above, it is certainly Corman's equivalent, printed---like Prynne's---on the inside back cover of each issue of *Origin*: 'ORIGIN is not for sale; it can be had for love, as it happens, not for money. [...] Priority will be offered those who show concern for the material involved, involved themselves with it, though not necessarily agreeing with its manner, matter, scope or delivery.'^[Prynne inadvertently reveals his intention to transform the distribution of *Prospect* in his first second to Olson: 'I would rather work to a private circulation & print what needs to come out (like ORIGIN), but don't have the choice as things are' (Prynne to Olson, 26 November 1961).] There are a number of other factors which make the conjunction an apt one. *Origin* had been launched in Spring 1951, its cover billing it as 'a quarterly for the creative'; this first issue included Olson's poem 'I, Maximus', which would become the initial element in the broader *Maximus Poems* project. While subsequent issues focused on other poets associated with the experimental Black Mountain College and the Beat movement such as Creeley and Gary Snyder, it would be fair to say that Olson remained the presiding artistic presence during the earliest years of the magazine, contributing both poetry and prose---indeed, his letters to the publication between 1950 and 1956 would subsequently be collected.^[Charles Olson, *Letters for Origin, 1950--1956*, ed. by Albert Glover (London: Cape Goliard, 1969).] *Prospect*, similarly, began with a significant contribution from Olson---the poem 'Maximus to Gloucester'---and published his work again in Issues 4 and 6.^[Olson, 'Maximus to Gloucester', *Prospect*, 1 (Summer 1959), pp. 19--20; Olson, 'A Plantation---A Beginning', *Prospect*, 4 (Spring 1960), pp. 21--23; Olson, 'Going Right Out of the Century', *Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), p. 33. A comma is inserted after 'Maximus' in the collected version of the former poem. Olson, 'Letter to Elaine Feinstein', in *Collected Prose*, pp. 250--52.] Though not printed, Olson's important 'Letter to Elaine Feinstein' was also sent during this period, adding to the sense of his involvement in the intellectual *milieu* surrounding the magazine.^[As Feinstein herself admits, 'I started [...] *Prospect*, not to publish my own poems, but to introduce Olson, Paul Blackburn and others who weren't yet known in this country' (Michael Schmidt, 'Elaine Feinstein in Conversation', *PN Review*, 24.2 [December 1997], 36--41 [p. 37]).] In aesthetic terms, *Origin* and *Prospect* also share a number of key features, both being issued in octavo format for most of their respective runs (*Prospect* grew slightly with Issue 5 and expanded even further after Prynne's takeover) and both being professionally offset printed. Indeed, *Origin* and *Prospect* begin to seem even more similar when compared to the opposite pole of post-war little magazine production: the mimeographed 'worksheet'. Although what has been termed the 'mimeo revolution' did not begin in earnest until the 1960s, outlying publications such as William Carlos Williams and Robert McAlmon's *Contact* had pioneered the technique of printing from typewritten stencils as early as 1920, while magazines like Amiri Baraka's *Yugen* (1958--62) had begun to re-exhibit the characteristic combination of avant-garde poetic content and ultra-low production values in the years immediately preceding *Prospect*'s launch.^[Tim Carmody, 'Paper Modernism', *Snarkmarket* (9 August 2009), \<http://snarkmarket.com/blog/snarkives/selfdisclosure/paper\_modernism/\> [accessed 29 January 2015].] Seen in relation to this increasingly popular and significantly cheaper method of production, the decisions made by Feinstein, Ward and Corman to maintain their respective magazines' professional formats---or, in Prynne's case, radically to boost the production values of *Prospect*---take on the character of positive artistic statements. In order to clarify the exact character of these implied statements, particularly Prynne's, it will be necessary to consider the field of British and American little magazine production in the early 1960s in more detail, looking at the influence of another publication, *Migrant* (1959--60).


## iii. Migration patterns, 1960--62

The role of Gael Turnbull's *Migrant* magazine in defining the contours of the British and American post-war poetic avant garde has, in recent decades, been widely acknowledged.^[Much of this acknowledgement has come from work by Price, including his 2007 article 'Migrant the Magnificent', *PN Review*, 33.4 (2007), pp. 29--34, and his curation of the British Library exhibition 'The Possibility of Poetry' the same year. This section, in turn, takes some of its cues from Price's recent 'CAT-scanning the Little Magazine', in *The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary British & Irish Poetry*, ed. by Peter Robinson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 173--90, as well as Kieran Healy's 'Using Metadata to Find Paul Revere' (9 June 2013), \<http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/\> [accessed 9 April 2014] and Franco Moretti's 'Network Theory, Plot Analysis', *New Left Review*, 68 (2011), pp. 80--102.] A Scottish medical doctor and poet, Turnbull began publishing the magazine as an offshoot of Migrant Books, which had been set up in 1956 to distribute work from small US poetry presses in the UK---notable books included the two early Jargon Society editions of Olson's *Maximus Poems*.^[Charles Olson, *The Maximus Poems / 1--10* (Highlands, NC: Jargon Society, 1953); Olson, *The Maximus Poems / 11--22* (Highlands, NC: Jargon Society, 1956).] As Richard Price points out, '[b]ecause so many of Turnbull's correspondents were poets Migrant Books became an early and key bridge across the Atlantic between British and American avant-garde writers.'^[Price, p. 30.] When Turnbull emigrated to California in 1958, he moved to shore up this link by opening a permanent channel of communication through the magazine. *Migrant* was produced in Turnbull's garage using a Sears Roebuck mimeograph machine, following the lead of publications like *Yugen*. Contributors---listed by surname only---were generally either Americans associated with Black Mountain (Olson, Dorn, Larry Eigner) or British writers with an interest in the new poetic developments coming out of the college and its associated periodicals. In this sense, leaving aside specific pairings such as Ian Hamilton Finlay and Edwin Morgan, the British side of *Migrant* was much more varied than the American, bringing together a miscellaneous range of poets---Charles Tomlinson, Hugh Creighton Hill, Turnbull's schoolfriend Michael Shayer---which was never likely to solidify into a coherent 'school' or 'movement' analogous to Black Mountain. In fact, the UK--US axis which predominates in practically every one of the magazine's eight issues leads to conjunctions which can seem distinctly odd from the perspective of a now-settled 20th-century literary history: a piece on John Osborne's *Look Back in Anger* sandwiched between poems by Corman and Robert Duncan in Issue 2 (September 1959), for example, or an article by Alan Brownjohn in Issue 6 (May 1960) comparing Creeley and Philip Larkin. *Migrant* was also eclectic in a formal sense, publishing letters, diary entries and transcriptions of tape recordings alongside the poems and reviews which more commonly feature in little magazines, an arrangement which Price describes as 'collage'.^[*Ibid*., p. 31.]

Though hardly as well-studied as the semi-legendary publications of High Modernism, the short-lived *Migrant* is often spoken of as a 'seminal' force, notable mainly for facilitating a transatlantic and intergenerational cross-fertilisation that would bear its healthiest fruit in what Eric Mottram famously called the 'British Poetry Revival 1960--1975'. If, as Brian Eno once claimed, everybody who bought a copy of the Velvet Underground's 1967 debut LP started a band, it seems equally likely that everybody who received an issue of *Migrant*---or at least the younger subscribers---became somehow involved in the running of a small press or the publication of a little magazine shortly afterwards. What is sometimes skated over in these sweeping, macro-genealogical assertions, however, is the exact form that such influence actually took. How did a magazine that ceased publication in 1960 have a significant effect on something like *The English Intelligencer*, a worksheet that wasn't started until 1966? That the similarities between Turnbull's and Andrew Crozier's ventures cannot be attributed solely to shared ancestry---the legacy of *Origin* or Creeley's *Black Mountain Review* (1954--57), for example---is clear: beyond equivalences of format and readership, there are editorial tendencies, such as the repeated inclusion of signed and unsigned correspondence, which mark the *Intelligencer* out as a direct descendant.^[Latter compares the *Intelligencer* to Stan Persky's *Open Space* (1964) (Latter, *Late Modernism*, p. 43). While that publication's low-budget aesthetic and explicitly geographical focus were certainly important influences, the tendency to cite it as a lone progenitor in the same breath as the *Intelligencer*---see statements in articles by Drew Milne ('Agoraphobia, and the embarrassment of manifestos: notes towards a community of risk', *Parataxis*, 3 [1993], 25--39 [p. 35]) and Nigel Wheale ('Breaking Cover: Peter Riley's "Passing Measures"', *Chicago Review*, 47.1 [2001], 110--17 [p. 112])---risks obscuring equally important forbears: not only *Migrant*, but other mimeographed organs such as *The Floating Bear* (1961--69), a publication whose influence Latter also acknowledges (Latter, *Late Modernism*, pp. 40--42). That the *Open Space* comparison seems to have originated with Peter Riley, the *Intelligencer*'s second editor, supports the case for caution (Riley, 'A Commentary on the Serial Poems of Jack Spicer' [unpublished MA thesis, University of Keele, 1975], p. 155).] Yet the actual bridges of influence across the above-mentioned six-year gap remain obscure.

This section will examine two little magazines published between 1960 and 1962---*Mica* and *Satis*---which both have strong claims to have fulfilled just this sort of bridging function, carrying aspects of the *Migrant* project over to later publications such as *The Resuscitator* (1963--69), *The Wivenhoe Park Review* and the later issues of *Prospect*. As well as chronological symmetry, there are a number of practical similarities between the two publications: both were distributed to relatively small circles of poets and readers and neither carried advertising, relying on subscription revenue and donations to finance their operations. Yet there are also some key differences, most notably in the areas of visual format and content. Crucially, Prynne was closely involved in both. While this section will focus primarily on providing a conventional literary-historical perspective, it will also employ social network analysis (SNA) techniques derived from sociology to offer a quantitative analysis of the magazines' contributor lists, establishing a series of empirical links at the same time as differentiating the two publications. In particular, it will attempt to determine whether *Mica* and *Satis* should be considered 'branches' or 'forks' in the *Migrant* project---terms taken from the vocabulary of software engineering which indicate, respectively, versions capable of being 'merged' into the main stream at some later date or new shoots set on a permanently divergent course. By means of this analysis, light will be shed on the pre-existing intellectual channels into which Prynne was obliged to insert much of his earliest poetry and prose, providing a base for a discussion of his attempts to forge a new path in the second half of this chapter.

Edited by Matthew Mead, *Satis* was published from Newcastle upon Tyne by Malcolm Rutherford, who would continue to issue books and pamphlets under the imprint well into the 1980s. Its first issue appeared in the autumn of 1960 with an editorial announcing baldly that 'Satis exists to publish poems', before clarifying that '[w]e cannot specify in advance the poetry we want---and for which we cannot pay---but can only promise to recognise that poetry when we see it' ('Editorial', *Satis*, 1 [1960], p. 2^[Subsequent inline citations of *Satis* editorials have been suppressed---they can all be found on p. 2 of their relevant issues.]). This recognition principle seems to have operated smoothly from the very beginning: the contents page for the first issue includes a well-filtered list of *Migrant*-affiliated poets---Turnbull, Michael Shayer, Anselm Hollo---as well as the comparatively well-known John Heath-Stubbs and a few outliers such as the Belgo-Irish poet Anne Cluysenaar and the American Frederick Eckman, known for his involvement with the *Golden Goose* magazine and chapbook series in the 1940s and '50s. The only name that seems to have fallen out of circulation is Anthony Smythe. Miller and Price describe *Satis* as 'rather restrained', noting a possible explanation for the title ('just "enough", and no more').^[David Miller and Richard Price, *British Poetry Magazines, 1914--2000* (London: British Library, 2006), p. 195. The immediate source of the term can be found in the motto printed on the inside cover of each issue: '*Satis.* Enough. *This remark written with the finger on the surface of an unbaked brick may mean either that the brick was the last of any particular batch; or it may be an idle remark made by the workman . . . . .* ---description alongside an inscribed Roman brick in the Silchester collection, Reading Museum'.] Nevertheless, the magazine's smart red cover and duodecimo format set it apart from the general pool of mimeographed and stapled organs, as does the professionally typeset and photolithographed content: sticking fairly rigidly to its stated mission, 'to publish poems', *Satis* might seem to have more in common with a well-presented university publication than with an avant-garde clearing house like *Migrant*.^[Aside from the editorials, the only exceptions to the 'Satis exists to publish poems' rule were regular short essays on individual poets, generally contributors.] This suspicion is confirmed by the editorials appearing on p. 2 of each issue, the tone of which is resolutely undergraduate---a message in Issue 2 (Spring 1961) notes that '[t]he publisher of this magazine reserves the right to disagree with any editorial statement which he may, eventually, understand', while Issue 3 (Summer 1961) acknowledges '[t]hose who despair of these editorials'.

For all their cryptic jocularity, these 200--300 word pieces do at least offer an explicit ethos for the magazine, and can be useful in clarifying the poetic and political positions of its editor and publisher. The editorial to Issue 1, for instance, declares that 'whilst we are certain that the training manuals of Mr. Pound have not been superseded, we feel that "modernist" poetry has suffered from a confusion of aim rather than of method', before somewhat idiosyncratically throwing its lot in with Robert Graves's 1948 mythological study *The White Goddess*. In Issue 2, Mead writes that 'it is clear that the adventure of rational materialism is over', seemingly dispensing with around three-hundred years of thought in the course of eleven words; however, he pre-empts any suspicion of neo-romanticism with contrarian self-satisfaction: 'we consider the notion that "men may be changed by what they imagine" to be as fallacious as the idea that men may be changed by an alteration in their environment.'^[Then again, the editorial to Issue 3 states that 'we should define what we like in American poetry as a matter-of-fact romanticism.'] That both of these 'notions' are plainly true does not seem to bother him. Politically, *Satis* maintains what at first seems an attitude of scrupulous independence, but which on closer inspection betrays a distinct anti-Soviet bias. In Issue 1, Mead 'recognises the end of those large planned hopes which have so plagued our century', going on to declare that '[w]e find ourselves unable to distinguish between the resultant industrial collectives except by the degree of freedom which they allow to the individual.' ('We have seen no little magazines from Chang-sha or Rostov', he jokes, as if little magazine production itself was to be considered the only reliable index of freedom.) In Issue 4 (Winter 1961--62), similarly, he lauds poetry's resistance to capitalist division of labour and its 'faithfulness to a conception of a limit', but reserves his real scorn for 'a transition to communism which includes the "scientific" persecution of dead poets' girlfriends', presumably a reference to Nadezhda Mandelstam.^[Mead's conception of 'faithfulness to a conception of a limit' as opposed to 'storming every available frontier and lapsing into any excess' finds a parallel in Prynne's early poem 'A Gold Ring Called Reluctance', first published in the *Intelligencer* in 1966. Here, as Sutherland has it, Prynne 'tells us that we should refuse to "commit ourselves thankfully" to the "needs" prepared for us by the economic reduction of the "public" to mere publicity ... That is, we should re-own our power to refuse not only the feast of commodities served up by late capitalism, but the whole personality ("who we / are") that it also serves up, experienced merely as administered "needs" and "wants"' (Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 99).]

The fifth and final issue of *Satis* appeared in the summer of 1962, at which point it ceased publication for what the issue's editorial describes as 'adequate reasons of love, money and lassitude'. This statement represents the apotheosis of a sort of commercial paranoia that had pervaded *Satis* from its very first issue. The initial editorial, for instance, jokingly invites '[h]eavy investments in [*Satis*'s] non-interest-bearing stock', while Issue 2 follows a request for subscriptions with the statement that '[c]heques, etc. should be made payable to the publisher. The publisher is under constant surveillance' (p. 1). Concerns about money are in fact most legible in the regular statements from the publisher printed on the magazine's inside cover. The first of these exhorts the reader, somewhat optimistically, to '[s]ave 12 of these tokens from successive Satis covers and win a sporting rifle for the office', with subsequent messages generally following the 'token' format: while Issue 2's message is a betting tip, Issue 3's 'will admit bearer to the publisher's lecture: *The Evils of Gambling*', presumably a reference to the magazine's inability to cover its costs. Issue 4 offers to let '[t]he reader with the most Satis tokens [...] ghostwrite the sensational memoirs of the publisher', while Issue 5 promises to 'admit the bearer' to a spurious 'Satis Closing-down dinner'. More interesting than the sheer fact of *Satis*'s demise are the administrative arrangements which accompanied it. Having sold 6/- (\$1.20) subscriptions promising three issues each (and offering no discount on the 2/- [\$0.40] cover price), Mead and Rutherford effectively owed many of their readers a sixth issue. The solution to the problem was given in the final issue's editorial:

> We are indebted to J. H. Prynne, the Editor of *Prospect*, for agreeing to our suggestion that subscriptions which would not have expired until our sixth number should be filled by *Prospect*. All subscriptions which run beyond that point will be returned. Any malcontent to whom this arrangement is not agreeable should write to us at once. We are sharpening everything.

As has been described above, *Prospect* 6 did not in fact appear until 1964, and the combination of extremely high production values and a limited budget made it the last in the series; nevertheless, the fact that it was deemed suitable literally to replace *Satis* says a lot about the connections between the two publications. Just as in Prynne's relations with *Origin*, it is difficult to imagine a closer form of association between periodicals than the exchange of a subscriber list, this being the almost-contractual expression of goodwill (financial or otherwise) that makes a project possible in the first place. Arguably, when individual issues and volumes are stripped away, a periodical actually *is* its subscriber list, a principle taken to an extreme by *The English Intelligencer*, which regularly printed lists of its recipients. Prynne contributed two poems to *Satis* 5, 'Early Yesterday Morning' and 'In Praise'. Setting aside the juvenilia described in the previous section, these rank among his very earliest published poems; yet the fact that both works were subsequently included in *Force of Circumstance* makes drawing threads of influence from *Satis* to later stages in Prynne's career---the period of his involvement with the *Intelligencer*, for example---a risky enterprise. To put it bluntly, *Force of Circumstance* has become something of a curiosity piece, of as much interest to collectors as to scholars, and this label threatens to spread from its poetic contents to the magazine pages in which they were originally printed. At this point, then, it will be important to provide some more details about *Mica*, the second magazine under examination here, before considering whether its links to Prynne imply a stronger claim to relevance.

*Mica*'s status as an heir to *Migrant* is undoubtedly better-established than that of *Satis*---in his 2007 article 'Migrant the Magnificent', Price describes the publication as a 'direct successor', while the finding aid for the Mica Collection at SUNY Buffalo notes that it was '[m]odeled after Gael Turnbull's magazine'.^[Price, p. 33; 'Finding aid for the Mica Collection, 1960--1962', *University at Buffalo, The State University of New York*, \<http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu:8080/findingaids/view?docId=ead/poetry/ubpo\_pcms0007.xml\> [accessed 27 March 2014].] Part of the reason for this may lie in the obvious similarities of format: mimeographed from typewritten stencils and folded crosswise, *Mica* clearly maintains the low-budget aesthetic established by the older publication. Edited jointly from the University of California, Santa Barbara by German and French emigrés Helmut Bonheim and Raymond Federman, the magazine managed to preserve some of *Migrant*'s transatlantic character, though in linguistic terms the content remains anglocentric. It also maintained very similar commercial arrangements, with subscriptions based entirely on donations: just as the first issue of *Migrant* declared that 'even a few stamps will be of help' (*Migrant*, 1 [1959], p. 18), *Mica* implores readers to 'send us dollars or even stamps to help defray the expense of production and mailing in the coming year' (*Mica*, 1 [1960], p. 5). *Mica*'s first issue appeared in December 1960, shortly after *Satis*'s debut, and the magazine ran for a total of seven issues, the final one being published in November 1962. While Bonheim and Federman generally eschewed direct editorializing, the inaugural issue includes an important 'Note from the Editors' which makes the *Migrant* connection explicit: 'In the belief that Gael Turnbull's MIGRANT stood among the best and most readable of the little magazines, the editors of MICA want to continue in its footsteps' (p. 4). Having made this hereditary claim, the note sets out some of the magazine's principles, including a commitment to 'the publication of non-genre pieces: sections of letters, journals, notes, remarks, and uncompleted pieces of interesting fiction.' The 'modesty of our present format' is, meanwhile, presented as 'a positive virtue: our contributors will probably be interested in finding discriminating readers rather than the flattery of a glossy publication' (pp. 4--5). This sense of provisionality, a far cry from *Satis*'s professional veneer, is reaffirmed by a quotation printed underneath the opening note and taken from an anonymous letter to *Migrant* 8:

> I think it is essential to regard the little magazine as semi-private, and not a self-sufficient world in itself. More like theatre in rehearsal than the presented performance. It is a kind of preparation for other things, a place where one can make one's mistakes and push forward one's tentative shoots both to one's own use and to those of the few others who can benefit from seeing them tried. But it is all subordinate to the ultimate break-through.

Before considering Prynne's involvement with *Mica*, it is worth dwelling briefly on the rhetoric of these editorial statements, and the sometimes problematic assumptions that they imply. The negative deployment of the word 'glossy', for instance, carries connotations that travel much further than the horizon of the literary world. When combined with 'flattery', it seems to derive much of its force from a more or less contemptuous attitude to 'women's magazines', a.k.a. 'the glossies', though according to the *OED* this negative coding reaches back at least as far as 1698 and '[t]he adulterate and glossy Customs in esteem among the Persians.'^['glossy, adj.', *OED Online* (Oxford University Press, 2014), \<http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/79186\> [accessed 14 May 2014]. *Mica*'s record on gender equality in publication is, perhaps surprisingly, streets ahead of something like the *The Wivenhoe Park Review*, which published only one woman, Elaine Feinstein, in its entire run. Even so, the proportion of female contributors in its pages barely hits 20 per cent.] 'Modesty', meanwhile, is used not merely in its financially euphemistic sense---as in 'modest means'---but also to signify a certain dignified reserve, something almost akin to *sprezzatura*. Of course, this supposed modesty does not prevent or preclude the 'ultimate break-through' hyperbolically celebrated in the letter from *Migrant*: the goal is the instigation of a tectonic shift in Anglo-American poetry *through* the 'tentative shoots' of the little magazine.

Prynne's contributions to *Mica* are more extensive than his contributions to *Satis*, a fact which is at least partly attributable to geography: given his position at Harvard, correspondence with the American magazine would presumably have been cheaper. A selection of *Force of Circumstance*-era poems in Issues 2 (February 1961) and 3 (June 1961) is followed by an extract from a letter in *Mica* 5 (Winter 1962) and a further poem, subsequently uncollected, in Issue 6 (June 1962). Of these, it is the letter, which occasioned responses in *Mica* 6 from both Theodore Enslin and Larry Eigner, that is of most immediate interest. Signed 'J.H. Prynne, Outer Hebrides', it presents his thoughts on the current state of American poetry, which he contrasts with 'the deliberately small aims and over-developed musculature of most English writers of verse' (*Mica*, 5 [1962], p. 3). Prynne is simultaneously laudatory and cautious, describing recent American work as 'a vast achievement' but warning that it too often 'offer[s] substitutes for experience instead of modes of access.' There are clear parallels between Prynne's concerns in this letter to *Mica*, which concludes with an exhortation to '[work] every preposition into the final contours of the poem and the shape of its own defining' (p. 28), and the argument that he puts forward in 'Resistance and Difficulty', published the previous year in *Prospect*. In this earlier text, which has gained a prominence in the scholarship somewhat out of sync with its length and publication date, Prynne draws on contemporary phenomenology to offer a distinction between the two concepts in its title: 'Difficulty, I suggest is the subjective counterpart to resistance: I experience difficulty when I encounter resistance. [... D]ifficulty is cognitively prior to resistance but ontologically dependent upon it.'^[Prynne, 'Resistance and Difficulty', p. 28.] He goes on to claim that '[i]t is the imagination's peculiar function to admit, draw sustenance from, and celebrate the ontological priority of [the] outside world, by creating entities which subsequently become a part of the world, an addition to it'---in other words, entities which are so well-crafted that they exhibit resistance.^[*Ibid*., p. 30.] It is difficult not to hear echoes of this doctrine in the assertion in the *Mica* letter that 'the object [of the poem] should not be the poet's anterior experience (Eliot's fundamental error), but the poem's achieved shape' (p. 28).

Like *Satis*, then, *Mica* is linked to *Prospect* through Prynne, though the poetic work that he contributed to both magazines would subsequently be disowned. Using the open source statistical computing software R, it is possible to represent these relationships visually, a process which also helps to illuminate broader patterns in what was earlier described as *Migrant*'s 'transatlantic and intergenerational cross-fertilisation'. Figure 2 shows a force-directed graph generated using the Fruchterman--Reingold algorithm and an adjacency matrix of contributors to *Migrant*, *Mica*, *Satis* and *Prospect*.^[The adjacency matrix was generated in R using a simple spreadsheet listing contributors (rows) and magazines (columns), where a '1' recorded presence in a given magazine and a '0' absence. This, in turn, was compiled by hand using the original contents pages of the respective magazines. For the purposes of analysis, all editors have been recorded as contributors to their own magazines, even when---as in the case of Gael Turnbull---they only printed their own work pseudonymously. Poets in translation, poets not alive at the time of publication and illustrators have not been counted as contributors, while translators and contributors of concrete poetry have. Fruchterman--Reingold is one of a family of algorithms used to generate force-directed graphs---it functions by simultaneously simulating attractive forces along each edge (much like springs or elastic) and more general repulsive forces between vertices. The final result shows this system in a state of equilibrium, with closely-linked vertices clustered together and weaker links further apart.] Each point (or 'vertex') represents a contributor, while the lines (or 'edges') indicate publication in the same magazine. It is clear at a glance that the links between these publications take the form of a series of clusters. Aside from the obvious groups representing contributors to only one magazine each, there are smaller gatherings at specific bridge points. The largest of these intermediate groups is that which spans *Migrant* and *Mica*, comprising Roy Fisher, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Edwin Morgan and five others---indeed, the strength of the connection between the two magazines, hypothesized from subjective evidence above, shows up clearly on the graph as a thick, grey band. This group is followed closely by a relatively clear *Migrant*--*Mica*--*Satis* cluster, which includes a number of key names: Gael Turnbull, Anselm Hollo, Matthew Mead, Larry Eigner and Barriss Mills. Arguably of more interest, statistically and historically, are the smaller pairs or groups of three which spin off from these two main networks. It is instructive to note, for example, that Olson, Dorn and Tomlinson---all important influences on Prynne---occupy virtually identical positions on the graph, connected directly to *Migrant* and *Prospect* but only indirectly to *Mica* and *Satis*. Likewise, the personal and poetic connections between Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov show up visually, as do the milieu shared by Michael Shayer and Godfrey John and the relative outsider status of Charles Bukowski and David Rafael Wang (no presence in *Migrant* or *Prospect*, but adopted temporarily by both *Mica* and *Satis*). Prynne himself occupies a highly central position, which is to be expected given the fundamental bias of the network, the magazines having been selected on the basis of his involvement in the first place.

![Contributors to *Migrant*, *Mica*, *Satis* and *Prospect*](../PNG/matrix_small.png)

Further insight into the relationships between the key magazines of this period can be gained by studying their links more directly---for instance, by counting the absolute numbers of shared contributors. This reveals that the number of contributors connecting *Migrant* to *The Resuscitator*, *Prospect* or *The Wivenhoe Park Review* is in virtually every case as high as or higher than that connecting *Mica* or *Satis* in the same direction, even when only the post-*Migrant* issues of *Prospect* are counted.^[The exception is the link connecting *The Wivenhoe Park Review* with *Mica* (five contributors), which is slightly stronger than the corresponding link with *Migrant* (four contributors). Both include important names: Olson and Dorn in the latter, Tom Raworth and Prynne in the former.] While this doesn't completely put paid to the 'bridging' thesis set out above, it does suggest that *Mica* and *Satis* are more than just temporary waypoints on a smooth journey from *Migrant* to later publications: rather than simply ferrying poets across a chronological gap, they strike out into new territory. This analysis is, of course, distorted by the varying absolute sizes of the contributor lists---the more contributors a magazine has overall, the more likely it is to share at least some of those contributors with another publication. Even so, this effect is both less pronounced than might be expected (*Mica* and *The Wivenhoe Park Review*, the two magazines with the longest contributor lists, have only the ninth strongest bond) and analytically significant in itself: if a magazine has a short contributor list but a high number of shared contributors, as in the case of *Migrant*, that says something important about its relation to the network as a whole.

That the lines connecting *Migrant* with something like the *The English Intelligencer* are various and interwoven can be confirmed by looking in more detail at the crop of little magazines that represent the latter's immediate influences. The first issue of *The Resuscitator* (Autumn 1963), for instance, was professionally printed by the Bristol firm Savage & White and resembled *Satis* in format, with an elegant cover billing it as 'a literary magazine'; as well as poems by its editors, John James, Nick Wayte and C.I. McNeill, it included work by such established figures as the Leavisite educationalist David Holbrook. By the time of the second issue in April 1964, McNeill had been dropped from the editorial board, the cover was hand-drawn, and the contents---which included Corman, Olson and Louis Zukofsky---were produced by 'electroprint' mimeograph. Higher and more consistent production values were maintained for the remainder of the first series, which featured a broad range of American and British poets, while the magazine's *Intelligencer*-era relaunch as *2R* saw it revert to a *Mica*-esque mimeographed square with a severely restricted, Cambridge-affiliated contributor list.^[A link to the past was nevertheless maintained by a dedication 'to CHARLES TOMLINSON with thanks for his generous help over the first series' (*2R1* [January 1968], p. 2).] As was noted in the previous section, a comparably extreme shift in format occurred when Prynne took over *Prospect*, with the magazine morphing from a modest octavo book with basic monochrome covers to a roughly quarto-sized and conspicuously well-designed volume. Yet while *Prospect* 6 could hardly be further removed from the *Intelligencer* in format, its editorial ethos anticipated the latter's attempt to establish new modes of artistic and commercial relation between British poets and the venues which published them---what Prynne, in a December 1966 letter to Crozier, terms a 'community of risk'.^[Prynne, letter (27 December 1966), in *Certain Prose*, 28--29 (p. 28).] This attitude, in turn, shares much more with the 'theatre in rehearsal' line running from *Migrant* through *Mica* than it does with the 'flattery of a glossy publication' offered by more established magazines.

Both statistically and qualitatively, then, *Mica* and *Satis* seem to toe a delicate line between being either forks or branches in the *Migrant* project---pulling in separate directions, formally and editorially, they nevertheless retain a core of shared code. From the perspective of the literary historian, these short-lived publications are worth studying for their own innovations and their divergent contributions to the Anglo-American poetic avant garde; but they also played the equally important role of 'keeping the flame alive' during 1960--62, providing venues in which the messy business of an already-established poetic tradition could continue to take place. This function would prove to be particularly important for younger poets like Prynne. Despite the fact that his poetic contributions to both magazines were subsequently collected and discarded as *Force of Circumstance*, Prynne's engagement with *Mica* and *Satis* is important in other ways. In the case of the former, his mixed poetic/prosaic practice in its pages is a clear precursor to later interactions with publications from *The English Intelligencer* to *Grosseteste Review* to *Rolling Stock*; on the other hand, the merging of *Satis* into *Prospect* and Prynne's editorship of the latter must have offered valuable practical experience in managing the sorts of headstrong personalities characteristic of the little magazine scene---experience which would prove particularly useful five years later, when in December 1967 Prynne, Crozier and John James removed Peter Riley as editor of the *Intelligencer*. If it makes sense to speak in market terms about a field of production so self-consciously non-commercial (and an event like the transfer of subscriptions from *Satis* to *Prospect* suggests that this might not be as incongruous as it seems), then *Mica* and *Satis* can be seen, finally, as functions of poetic supply and demand, filling a temporary gap in the market---and making use of the limited amount of freedom afforded by this position---before being displaced in their turn.^[Of course, demand is a concept of limited explanatory value in a market where 'consumers' are, more often than not, also producers; rather than a demand for actual poetic commodities, what it might end up designating is a demand for the literary infrastructure used to circulate those commodities. This seems even more true of the world of avant-garde/small-press poetry than it is of poetry in general, though an optimist might hope that the famous dictum that 'more people write poetry than read it' tends more towards an even balance in the case of the former.] Describing the situation in 1960, Price notes that '[*Migrant*] may have closed, but this was because the scene, as it were, had now been set: books themselves were to carry on the Migrant idea.'^[Price, p. 32.] The truth in this statement needs to be acknowledged. Some chapbooks and pamphlet series are in formal terms---taking into account the material conditions of their production and the 'production values' thereby implied---practically indistinguishable from little magazines, while even more substantial books from small presses can offer zones of provisionality and experiment of the sort more commonly found in periodicals. Still, Price's assertion ultimately invites a response of 'yes, but': to focus exclusively on books as the carriers of 'the Migrant idea'---a communal project whose internal rifts and asymmetries must, of course, be interrogated in their own right---would be to ignore the important bridging work done by short-lived, 'liminal' organs like *Mica* and *Satis*, even as they pursued other avenues of experiment.


## iv. Reconnecting the threads

The previous two sections of this chapter have attempted to convey the profound diversity---formal, editorial, economic---that exists even within the relatively narrow definition of the little magazine which was proposed in its introduction. Yet through the deployment of Prynne's early poetic career as a connecting thread, they have also tried to demonstrate these periodicals' interdependence as elements in a broader artistic scene. The present section will shift the focus from the magazines themselves to Prynne's contributions---specifically, his prose contributions. What caused Prynne, during a period of intense activity both in his professional life as a university teacher and in his nascent career as a poet, to write in prose? Perhaps more importantly, what function do these prose works serve in the specific contexts of their publication? Having so far confined discussion to the period leading up to the publication of the first issue of the *Intelligencer* in 1966, the scope of the inquiry will now be extended to include this particular periodical.

As the quotations from Prynne's earliest letters to Olson and Dorn indicate, his attitude towards prose as editor of *Prospect* was one of cynicism. His language when describing the magazine makes it resemble a fortification which must be protected at any cost from the 'hostile [and] parochial mediocrity [of the] English university', with 'prose theory' being one of the key tools by means of which 'the wiseacres' might gain a 'foothold' in its walls.^[Prynne to Olson, 26 November 1961.] If radical new American poetry is to be printed in England, it must speak for itself; indeed, if it is to truly speak at all, it can only do so *by* itself, unmediated either by the mass-produced scholarship of the 'knowledge industry' or by professional criticism---what Prynne describes to Dorn as 'discussion/speculation about issues, poetic theory, problems of the writer'---both of which are equally corrupt and decrepit.^[Prynne to Dorn, 17 June 1965; Prynne to Dorn, 29 November 1961.] Yet there is one very obvious problem with taking this anti-prose posture at face value: when *Prospect* 6 was published in Spring 1964, it included prose. In fact, fully one third of the magazine's 42 pages are devoted to it, in a broad array of forms that encompasses fiction, review and 'poetic theory', with Prynne himself contributing one of the key pieces and Davie---a figure who, as Chapter 1 showed, was certainly not immune from charges of wiseacrey by this point---contributing another. The potential explanations for this disjunct are twofold: either Prynne's original editorial vision for *Prospect* 6 was compromised by social or economic forces outside of his control (a hint of these forces is given as early as November 1961, when he tells Corman that 'pressures inherited that I can't side-step' mean that *Prospect* will have to carry a review of Davie's *A Sequence for Francis Parkman*); or, his attitude towards the usefulness of prose did in fact shift between these early letters and the magazine's eventual publication.^[Prynne to Corman, 19 November 1961.] The evidence of the issue itself lends weight to the latter explanation. While the inclusion of Davie's contribution---a short piece on the American poet Alan Stephens---might perhaps be attributed to 'pressures inherited' (though it might just as well not), it hardly makes sense to say the same about Prynne's own review, of Douglas Woolf's five-year-old novel *Fade Out* (1959). Prynne did not even have Woolf's address in May 1964, and if he had been under any obligation to review the book by Woolf's long-time champion Creeley, it hardly seems likely that he would have wasted a further four pages of 'Conqueror blue white laid paper' on printing the latter's short story 'The Grace' as well.^[Prynne to Dorn, 6 May 1964; *Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), pp. 25--28.] Equally, it is difficult to see how an editor who was so single-mindedly fastidious about the issue's design---single-minded to the point of delaying publication for three years and eventually bankrupting the magazine---could have tolerated such an obvious compromise on the level of content.

That Prynne's conception of the relationship between prose and little magazines evolved away from the exclusionary rhetoric of 1961 is confirmed by one particularly revealing letter sent to Peter Riley six years later. The letter apparently accompanied a copy of the so-called 'prose issue' of *The English Intelligencer*, which though edited by Riley for its second series was substantially produced---in the material sense of physical duplication, and often in terms of arranging the content into stencils---by Prynne, with the assistance of both Andrew and Jean Crozier and John James.^[Latter, *Late Modernism*, pp. 25--26. As Latter points out, the fact that the *Intelligencer* was 'produced for free on a mimeograph machine in Gonville and Caius [makes it] exempt from at least one of the definitive features that Peter Brooker and Andrew Thacker use to characterize the modernist little magazine, namely that it is "short-lived, committed to experiment, in constant financial difficulties, and indifferent or directly opposed to commercial considerations"' (p. 26). It also reveals the salience of the term 'formally independent' in this thesis's own definition).] As Alex Latter notes, the worksheet had under Riley's editorship been moving steadily away from being simply a collection of poems and towards the provision of a more comprehensive range of 'information', generally in the form of long letters and other prose pieces. Interviewed by Latter for a doctoral thesis, James recalls that 'the balance between poetry and non-poetry was increasingly skewed. Towards the end Jeremy [Prynne] expressed his dissatisfaction with the whole thing in no uncertain terms, one night deciding enough was enough. [...] This was the moment of what I refer to ... as the Palace Revolution, the night of 6 December 1967.'^[John James, quoted in Latter, '"News that STAYS news"', p. 231.] The letter from Prynne to Riley under consideration here can be situated precisely in the period referred to by James as 'towards the end', being sent in mid-September 1967. Riley's intention to print a formal 'prose issue' had been announced at least twice in previous issues of the *Intelligencer*; yet once it had been put together in its final form, Prynne described the collection which he had just sent off to Riley as 'a weak assemblage, mostly midget fictions or would-be lyric gestures'.^[*Certain Prose*, pp. 139, 143; Prynne to Riley, 15 September 1967. Subsequent quotations in this section are all from this letter, unless otherwise stated.] It is clear that Prynne's unhappiness with the issue stems not from the bare fact of printing prose rather than poetry, but from what he sees as the poor quality of the prose that Riley has chosen to print (though he may have been choosing from a limited pool): 'if a whole culture *supports* itself on its prose (whatever it might aspire onwards from that base), is this all we have?'^[This should perhaps already have been clear, given that Prynne was one of the foremost contributors of prose to the *Intelligencer* throughout its run---as well as numerous letters, the worksheet had by this point printed 'A Note on Metal' and 'A Pedantic Note in Two Parts'.] James's collocation of the 'skewed' balance between 'poetry and non-poetry' with 'Jeremy express[ing] his dissatisfaction' is therefore misleading; in fact, Prynne seems to assign a hugely important role to prose, describing it as nothing less than the 'base' of culture. He continues in this vein:

> We can't & I presume shouldn't ~~presume~~ expect to evolve all our thinking into poems, where the complication of *opinion* and the inter-modifying force of open *argument* has to give way to the closed form. A poem isn't "to be disagreed with" and thus evolutionary & self-extending: it has a discrete priviledge as self-sufficient ("for its own sake", whatever *that* means), just as soon as it's set down on paper. I would look to prose to expand the base, to equip and exercise the person, literally to keep us sane. Otherwise we topple into bigotry---our poems, though of course *not* considered, *not* level & judged, *must* be right. Prose is the way such extension into the world might be less armour-plated, more provisional for heaven's sake, and I don't mean picturesque short stories.

According to this statement, prose not only *is* the base of culture, but also serves to *expand* that base according to an 'evolutionary & self-extending' logic. It is a form characterised by its provisionality---its competence, if not always willingness, 'to be disagreed with'---and therefore forms a natural home for 'the complication of *opinion* and the inter-modifying force of open *argument*'. This phenomenon, in turn, through a process which Prynne describes as 'exercise', 'keep[s] us sane' and prevents 'us' from 'toppling into bigotry'. Though expressed in sweeping terms, this is hardly a controversial view of the role of argumentative discourse; in fact, it could be read as a condensation or a restricted prefiguration of any number of eminently uncontroversial---even liberal---models of discursive rationality, from the Socratic method to Jürgen Habermas's *Theory of Communicative Action* (1981). By the same token, it contains some common blind-spots, most notably the obscurity of the referent of the collective noun 'us', a group which is able to assume sanity and freedom from bigotry but which is never formally defined, and which is perhaps fringed by a penumbra of insane bigots.

That Prynne is thinking of prose in specifically political terms is confirmed by what follows in the letter. Having offered the model above, he copies out a long passage from Shelley's *A Philosophical View of Reform* (1820, first printed 1920), in which the poet attacks Thomas Malthus's well-known views on population control, as expressed in *An Essay on the Principle of Population* (1798). Shelley characterises the ability to marry and reproduce as 'the one thing which made it impossible to degrade [the poor] below the beasts', and later as 'that property which is as strictly their birthright as a gentleman's land is his birthright', noting that the desire to reproduce is 'a propensity which persons of the most consummate wisdom have been unable to resist, and which it is difficult to admire a person for having resisted.'^[Percy Bysshe Shelley, *A Philosophical View of Reform* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1920), p. 52. The passage quoted by Prynne stops at this point, having begun at 'A writer of the present day' on p. 51 in the Oxford edition.] Prynne seems to concur, telling Riley that

> Here *we* have in our hands the *immediate* instrument; and the pathos of Shelley's tract, noble as it is, urgently has to be re-written for us now, with all the hormonal sophistication of birth-control & modern demography. Genetic servo-mechanisms and the sophistry of current welfare-economics are what we should work our way towards, keeping our balance in prose in counterpoise to that *furor poeticus* which now so quickly slides into paranoid hysterics.

What was it that made 'the pathos of Shelley's tract'---as opposed, presumably, to its ethos or logos---particularly relevant at this historical juncture? It is true that the so-called 'population debate' was as alive in the late 1960s as it was at almost any point in its history. A newspaper report from the same month as Prynne's letter describes an academic symposium on 'Our crowded world' at which some participants were accused of inciting 'a new "anti-population hysteria"', while in the United States the Population Crisis Committee (PCC), founded in 1965, had already achieved some notable successes in its mission to curb population growth in the developing world.^['Hysteria over population', *The Times* (6 September 1967), p. 13. According to John F. May, the PCC was 'most influential in the creation of key population institutions, like UNFPA, and helped establish an Office of Population within USAID' (John F. May, *World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact* [Berlin: Springer, 2012], p. 94, n. 1).] The science fiction novel *Logan's Run* (1967), a dystopian narrative in which the population level is maintained by executing all citizens at the age of twenty-one, even shows these concerns seeping into popular culture.^[In the 1976 film adaptation starring Michael York, future society is explicitly controlled by 'servo-mechanisms', though this is not a term used in the book. A higher-brow carrier for similar concerns is Margaret Atwood's debut novel *The Edible Woman* (1969), written in 1965, in which graduate student Fischer ('Fish') Smythe proposes a thesis on 'Malthus and the Creative Metaphor', tracking the supposedly 'inescapable connection between the rise of the birth-rate in modern times, say the past two or three centuries, especially the eighteenth to the middle of the nineteenth, and the change in the way the critics have been thinking about poetry' (Margaret Atwood, *The Edible Woman* [London: Virago, 2009], p. 244).] A more immediate answer can, however, be found in one of the key pieces of legislation occupying Parliament in the latter half of 1967: the Abortion Bill. Having been introduced as a private member's bill by the future Liberal leader David Steel in 1966, the legislation officially known as the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill passed its third reading in the Commons on 14 July 1967, after what *The Times* reported was the longest sitting in more than 16 years.^[Hugh Noyes, 'Abortion Bill over Last Commons Hurdles: Hint on Conscience Clause', *The Times* (15 July 1967), p. 2.] Its key aspect was a broad provision for legal abortion in cases where continuing the pregnancy would injure the 'physical or mental health' either of the mother or of any existing children, within the 28-week limit set down in the Infant Life Preservation Act 1929. Following the introduction of a number of amendments in the Lords, the bill was finally passed on 27 October, with party whips allowing MPs to vote along lines of conscience.

Prynne's letter to Riley of 15 September thus sits in the middle of a period of ferocious political debate about a highly controversial and complex issue of human reproduction. Yet despite specifying 'birth-control & modern demography' as appropriate subjects for argument, Prynne seems to avoid engaging with the debate from any recognizable political position.^[Prynne to Riley, 15 September 1967.] What, for example, does he mean by 'the sophistry of current welfare-economics'? This phrase seems to refer to the hot topic of 'selectivity', i.e. the proposed means-testing of some state benefits, and could, given the ambiguity of the hinge-word 'current', equally have been uttered from a right-wing, anti-welfare position as from a left-wing, statist one (or even from a more complex mixture of the two); indeed, the governing Labour Party was not itself in agreement over the issue.^[A brief contemporary analysis of Labour policy over welfare selectivity is provided by Alan Watkins, 'About-turn on welfare', *The Spectator* (22 June 1967), p. 3--4.] 'Genetic servo-mechanisms' is even more obscure: is Prynne referring to welfare policy, new methods of birth control (the female contraceptive pill became available through the National Health Service in 1961) or even abortion as 'servo-mechanisms'?---in other words, devices which use negative feedback to regulate the behaviour of systems, in this case presumably to control the population level. If he is, then what is his position on the ethical character of these mechanisms, and what does his use of the word 'genetic' imply about the agency of the human beings---primarily women---involved?^[An idea of Prynne's general attitude towards government 'intervention' is given in a 1986 letter to Douglas Oliver; responding to the latter's long poem *The Infant and the Pearl*, an hallucinatory dream vision involving Margaret Thatcher, Prynne declares that 'since behaviorism sponsors Regulation and Closure which are worst when most nearly beneficial and humane, I cannot voluntarily accept the maximalism of the left intervention ('planning') upon which its scheme of equitable hope has surely to be based. But by ethical compulsion I can and do, as a kind of self-wounding scourge against advantageous injustice by which the benefit is cruelly mine' (Prynne to Douglas Oliver, 16 February 1986).]

While the two phrases just considered are given as subjects which 'we should work our way towards', it is far from clear what Prynne intends to do once 'we' reach them. This hesitancy is not, moreover, a necessary or even a desirable feature of prose according to Prynne's own earlier definition, which deliberately downplays the importance of being 'right': prose is supposed to be 'less armour-plated' than poetry, remaining constantly vulnerable to attack. Yet there is a countervailing emphasis throughout the letter: like the reference to 'sanity' considered above, the celebration of 'keeping our balance in prose' rather than 'sliding' through poetry into 'paranoid hysterics' seems directed towards the establishment of a zone of rationality based on an essentially conventional, clinical definition of mental illness, with all the problems that such a definition entails. Prynne seems simultaneously to call for a 'community of risk' and for a discursive arena in which participants will carefully 'keep their balance'; for a mode of argument in which contributions will be 'provisional' and potentially falsifiable, but in which they will not be 'hysterical'. Most importantly, he establishes himself as a figure competent to police the border between this arena---implicitly coextensive with the *Intelligencer*, at least in its ideal form---and its outside. This is made clear in an astonishingly vicious attack on David Chaloner which follows closely on Prynne's comments on Shelley. Chaloner had contributed four pieces to the issue, the last being an account of a bonfire in somewhat purple descriptive prose ('A smell of damp leaves & smoke cloaks the octoberal, rusting garden').^[David Chaloner, 'Bonfire', *The English Intelligencer*, 2.12 (September 1967), p. 477.] As Chaloner's contributions did not completely fill two stencils, Prynne used the remaining space on the second page to print a quotation from former US Treasury official Robert Roosa about plans to stimulate liquidity in global financial markets.^[Robert V. Roosa, 'Judging the New Liquidity Plan', *The Banker*, 117.499 (September 1967), p. 756. The quotation selected by Prynne begins at 'The overriding test' and ends with 'lose balance and collapse.'] He explained this decision to Riley as follows:

> The sentimentalism is so hopelessly *irrelevant*: Chaloner is the worst, and his last piece is an enormity of feeble-mindedness, modish & inert. He may think that the paragraph I added below (to 'fill up space') was intended as 'ironic contrast', but its confident & level claim to be firmly talking about the real world will steam-roller our lyric adolescent's flabby little soul into a faint stain on the tarmac.

Prynne here flies in the face of his own *paean* to 'the inter-modifying force of open *argument*': his implicit riposte to Chaloner is not made on the level of content, through argumentative discourse, but by means of form, with Prynne relying on his pseudo-editorial position---a position based on little more than his having access to a communal college mimeograph machine---to manipulate the publication's layout in such a way that it will undermine Chaloner's piece. Crucially, through the parenthetical 'to "fill up space"', he effectively admits to Riley that the move is underhand.

In summary, Prynne's letter to Riley of 15 September 1967 sets out an ambiguous model for a new sort of prose which, given the events referred to by James as the 'Palace Revolution' and the worksheet's subsequent demise after just six more issues, it seems safe to assume was not achieved by *The English Intelligencer*. Prynne quotes a letter from Shelley to John and Maria Gisborne, sent while the poet was writing *A Philosophical View of Reform*, in which he declares that 'I have deserted the odorous gardens of literature to journey across the great sandy desert of politics.'^[Shelley to John and Maria Gisborne, 13 November 1819, in *The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley*, vol. 2, ed. by Frederick L. Jones (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1964), p. 150.] '[M]aybe we should take to the desert as well,' suggests Prynne---'honourable Beduins'. His hesitation is telling, however. Writing to Riley in what is presumably his next letter, Prynne acknowledges that '[m]y last note was a bit irritable I'm afraid, but I was writing a bit under pressure from *interesting* prose: cannot it too be joined more freely into the world.'^[Prynne to Riley, unattached second page of letter.] It is not clear whether Prynne intends the underlined 'interesting' to be read in a sarcastic sense, and thus for it to refer to the contents of the *Intelligencer*, or whether he is referring to some other genuinely interesting prose---perhaps even the Robert Roosa article---that he was reading at the time. Whichever interpretation is correct, his subsequent call for prose to be 'joined more freely into the world' seems to reiterate his wish for a political turn in the *Intelligencer*'s non-poetic work, as described in the 15 September letter. Yet the evident failure of this turn to manifest itself cannot be attributed solely to Prynne's fellow-contributors. As described above in relation to Chaloner, Prynne deliberately avoids playing by his own discursive rules. Moreover, when he does make individual prose contributions to the *Intelligencer*, they most often take the form of personally-addressed letters taking on issues of poetry or providing meta-commentary on the worksheet itself. At this point, then, this chapter will move to consider one of Prynne's longer prose contributions, 'A Note on Metal', to determine whether the apparent dissonance between his claims to Riley and his actual practice can be more effectively understood.


## v. A Note on History

'A Note on Metal' is the most widely distributed of Prynne's prose works prior to texts such as 2008's 'Huts' and 2010's 'Mental Ears and Poetic Work', which owe their circulation to the relatively recent phenomena of the online journal and the easily-sharable PDF file. The work was first published in *The English Intelligencer* as one of a series of responses to Peter Riley's 'Working Notes on British Prehistory, or Archaeological Guesswork One', which had appeared as a supplement at the conclusion of the worksheet's first series.^[Prynne, 'A Note on Metal', in *Certain Prose*, pp. 104--09; Riley, 'Working Notes on British Prehistory, or Archaeological Guesswork One', in *ibid*., pp. 47--73.] It was subsequently printed in pamphlet form alongside the poems 'Aristeas, in Seven Years', 'Star Damage at Home' and 'Frost and Snow, Falling', and has since been included in every edition of Prynne's collected poems.^[Prynne, 'A Note on Metal', in *Aristeas* (London: Ferry Press, 1968), pp. 14--17; *Poems* (Edinburgh and London: Agneau 2, 1982), pp. 125--30; *Poems* (Tarset: Bloodaxe, 1999), pp. 127--32; *Poems* (Tarset: Bloodaxe, 2005), pp. 127--32; *Poems* (Tarset: Bloodaxe, 2015), pp. 127--32.] 'A Note on Metal' is, then, a text with more than one context: initially embedded in the argumentative back-and-forth of the *Intelligencer* described earlier in this chapter, it has also been presented as supplementary to a series of poems and as a relatively self-sufficient, 'standalone' piece.^['A Note on Metal' does not appear directly adjacent to any of the *Aristeas* poems either in the *Intelligencer* or in any of the editions of *Poems*; as such, scholars should be wary of positing any too-rigid connection between them.] It is the first and last of these contexts with which this discussion is primarily concerned. Both C.D. Blanton and Seeta Chaganti have examined 'A Note on Metal' in detail, while Simon Jarvis, Robin Purves, Reitha Pattison, Alex Latter, Alistair Rider and Nicholas Royle have all considered it more briefly.^[C.D. Blanton, 'Nominal Devolutions: Poetic Substance and the Critique of Political Economy', *Yale Journal of Criticism*, 13 (2000), pp. 129--51; Seeta Chaganti, 'Vestigial Signs: Inscription, Performance, and The Dream of the Rood', *PMLA*, 125 (2010), pp. 48--72; Jarvis, 'Quality and the non-identical in J.H. Prynne's "Aristeas, in Seven Years"', *Parataxis*, 1 (1991), 69--86 (p. 83); Robin Purves, 'Commentary on J.H. Prynne's "Thoughts on the Esterházy Court Uniform"', *Glossator*, 2 (2010), 79--88 (pp. 80--81); Reitha Pattison, 'J.H. Prynne's "The Corn Burned By Syrius"', *ibid*., 89--114 (pp. 103--14); Alex Latter, '"Scheming for the possible world": J.H. Prynne's *The White Stones* and *The English Intelligencer*', *Intercapillary Space* \<http://intercapillaryspace.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/scheming-for-possible-world-j.html\> [accessed 17 March 2015] (para. 2); Alistair Rider, 'The "Curve over the Crest of the Hill": Carl Andre and Richard Long', in *Anglo-American Exchange in Postwar Sculpture, 1945--1975*, ed. by Rebecca Peabody (Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications, 2011), 133--47 (pp. 140--42); Nicholas Royle, *Veering: A Theory of Literature* (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), p. 51, n. 42.] Without exception, these accounts use the text as tool to examine some other aesthetic object---usually one of Prynne's poems, or, in the cases of Blanton, Chaganti and Rider, poems by Basil Bunting and Geoffrey Hill, Anglo-Saxon artefacts and 20th-century sculpture respectively. Blanton's account of the piece is by far the most detailed, situating it in a political tradition occupied simultaneously by Ruskin and Marx; nevertheless, this reading is offered with the ultimate intention of making a point about poetic practice and form, rather than of considering the text on its own terms, as prose. Rather than cite a pre-existing summary of 'A Note on Metal' and risk distorting its analysis in the direction of another scholar's project, this section will therefore begin with a fresh paragraph-by-paragraph synopsis, before undertaking a political reading of the text which will engage with existing judgements, particularly Blanton's, where appropriate. The synopsis will take the more opaque aspects of the text at face value, leaving their explanation to the subsequent analysis; for the sake of clarity, however, a rough schematic representation of the piece's argument has been provided in Figure 3.

![The argument of *A Note on Metal*](../PNG/a_note_on_metal.png)

¶1 (p. 128^[Inline citations in this chapter refer to the 2005 edition of *Poems*.]): Before the early Bronze Age, property resided uncomplicatedly in substance, and the 'most specific carrier for the inherence of power' was weight, found most obviously in stone. Stone is ambiguous, offering both a hard outside and, through erosion or carving, a protective inside, but weight is its crucial property. ¶2 (128): Metals such as copper and tin are more complex, having 'brightness, hardness [and] ductility' as well as weight. Alloys abstract property from substance even further, making it formal. The naturally uneven geographical distribution of metallic elements encouraged the Sumerians to acquire tin from as far away as Cornwall; yet there is an obvious difference in intent between this sort of trade and the physical transportation of the materials for Stonehenge. ¶3 (128): The strength of metal when forged in fire was 'infinitely more abstract' than that of flint or wood and allowed for rapid developments in hunting, fishing and agriculture. A 'spiritual' importance thus became attached to the sorts of sharp edges characteristic of metal tools, marking a shift from 'the history of substance (stone)' into 'the theory of power (metal)'. ¶4 (128--29): That said, this shift may actually have caused a 'deeper cultural adherence' to stone, a material not primarily related to the practicalities of everyday active life, but to a different sort of 'persistence through material transmutation'---hence its use to mark death. ¶5 (129): Advances in metallurgy shifted communities more rapidly from hunting to agriculture, allowing for the idea of 'place' and making mining possible. Threshing of grains encouraged the development of a theory of value even more abstract than the 'mixed relativism of substance' associated with alloys: a 'specialised function [...] dependent on the rate of exchange.' General abstraction of value through metallurgy and otherwise became the basis for a politics of wealth, with currency objects still measured by weight rather than by number. ¶6 (129--30): Currency initially carried a residual sacrality due to 'the magical implications of transfer', but eventually became 'iconized', with number replacing strength or power as the 'chief assertion of presence'. Because this sort of currency is best suited to trading over large distances, trade routes expanded. ¶7 (130): The shift of wealth from power to value can be seen most clearly in interactions between different societies, e.g. 'the sea-borne traders of the Eastern Mediterranean and the peoples of the Anatolian hinterland'. For the latter, wealth was determined by the power directly to control flocks of sheep, a 'politics of limit'; the former 'were already middlemen', relying on 'the trick of abstract distance between real supply and real demand.' ¶8 (130): Geographical factors caused what we know as coinage, representing 'sheer mercantile distance', to first emerge in the Eastern Mediterranean. Croesus further abstracted value by creating a bimetallic currency system. This increasingly rapid flight from 'presence as weight' allowed for the development of a 'complete middle class' based on the techniques of this flight, but also of 'an exilic (left-wing) history of substance.' ¶9 (130--31): This is a complex and involuted history. Abstraction of value is not always deleterious and unmediated substance is not always to be favoured, and is perhaps not even possible at all. Human awareness is sharpened by some of the 'shifts' away from substance, and stone is, in fact, already abstraction ('of standing, of balance'). It is not a matter of identifying the crucial and catastrophic turning point, but of looking clearly at 'the increasing speed of displacement which culminates only later in the critical overbalance of intent.'

As will by now be obvious, Prynne's style in 'A Note on Metal' is highly telegraphic. The text contains many gaps---not so much gaps in archaeological evidence, which is amply provided in the series of dense endnotes, but gaps in argument. Frequently, Prynne will move from the specific to the general in a transition so sharply telescopic that it cannot but be disorienting, even for experienced readers of his work; at other times, he will make use of apparently familiar words or phrases in radically unfamiliar contexts, rendering already convoluted sentences even more difficult to parse. Ryan Dobran claims that 'A Note on Metal' is a text which 'fails to explicate or consistently group the various concepts it discusses; it is patchy and meandering.'^[Ryan Dobran, 'J.H. Prynne's "Aristeas, in Seven Years" and *The English Intelligencer*', *Journal of British and Irish Innovative Poetry*, 5.2 (2013), 20--42 (p. 39, n. 15).] On the contrary, the text's difficulty stems precisely from its tightly compressed structure, a structure which admits gaps (it is 'patchy'), but which is far from 'meandering'---in fact, it is highly organised. This discussion will now address five key *lacunae* in 'A Note on Metal', with the hope both of further clarifying Prynne's text and of approaching the relationship between prose, politics and history which is to be the ultimate subject of this section. The choice of which gaps to analyse is necessarily personal, and is determined to a large extent by the contours of the synopsis given above; nevertheless, what this approach sacrifices in comprehensiveness it will perhaps regain in the coherence of the subsequent argument.

*1. Prynne relies on a number of technical philosophical terms---most obviously 'substance', but also 'abstraction' and 'quality'---without explaining the context in which they are used, or making any reference to the intellectual tradition from which they are taken.*

This is perhaps the most serious issue to be confronted in any reading of 'A Note on Metal', with the interpretation of Prynne's basic terminology likely to inform almost every aspect of subsequent analysis. Foremost among the terms used by Prynne is 'substance', a concept with a history almost as long as philosophy itself. In the present context, its most relevant formulation would appear to be that which derives from Hegel's reading of Spinoza. Hegel famously claimed, in his 1805--06 lectures on the history of philosophy, that 'thought must begin by placing itself at the standpoint of Spinozism; to be a follower of Spinoza is the essential commencement of all Philosophy.'^[G.W.F. Hegel, *Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Medieval and Modern Philosophy*, trans. by E.S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1995), p. 257.] What made Spinoza important for Hegel was the former's repudiation of Cartesian dualism, which resulted in a form of substance monism, substance being identified with a pantheistic God. For Spinoza, in Hegel's reading, '[t]he true is simply and solely the one substance, whose attributes are thought and extension or nature: and only this absolute unity is reality, it alone is God.'^[*Ibid*., p. 256.] This dissolving of the Cartesian subject--object divide makes room for Hegel's more complex reinterpretation of the subject *as* object, with his well-known emphasis on dialectically achieved self-consciousness. Prynne's argument in 'A Note on Metal', however, seems to differ significantly from the Hegelian perspective. Most obtrusive in this respect is his apparent lack of concern for subjective self-consciousness or will; or, to reframe it positively, his persistent concern with the object. Throughout 'A Note on Metal', the direction of argument extends relentlessly from material conditions to human action; when the latter is described, it is invariably as a consequence of the former, which goes on in turn to create further material conditions and further consequences. Croesus may have created a bimetallic currency system (¶8), but this was the inevitable result of the availability of the relevant materials, and he certainly didn't reflect on his role in the ever-increasing abstraction of value (or, if he did, this fact is irrelevant). In other words, Prynne---like Hegel's most famous reader, Marx---is rigorously materialist in his approach.^[In fact, as will be argued later in this chapter, Prynne is---deliberately---even more of a materialist than Marx.] As Keston Sutherland puts it, ventriloquising Prynne, 'the subject who engrosses the whole of truth is a disgusting contraption for silencing objects [...] and is fundamentally predatory and imperial in its reach'.^[Sutherland, '*Sub Songs* versus the subject: Critical variations on a distinction between Prynne and Hegel', in *Hix Eros: On the Late Poetry of J.H. Prynne*, 123--141 (p. 129).]

Why, then, does Prynne use the philosophically loaded term 'substance', when there are plenty of other words---'matter', for example---which would allow him to avoid idealist associations altogether? Why, indeed, does he not reframe his account in such a way that it would be unnecessary to name that which is abstracted from, given that any technical term---'substance', 'matter', 'being'---is inevitably already an abstraction? 'A Note on Metal' is, after all, a text which is explicitly concerned with the deleterious effects of abstraction, making the reproduction of that process in its own form particularly glaring. It is possible to offer a preliminary explanation by relating Prynne's use of language to his concern for the object described above. For Prynne, as the early text 'Resistance and Difficulty' makes clear, language once used takes on an ontological status comparable to that of any other object in the world, contributing to a general 'resistance' which is experienced as 'difficulty' and which gives us a form of immediate knowledge about our surroundings.^[The exact status of this knowledge will be considered below.] This position leads to an apparently paradoxical situation in which, as Sutherland puts it, 'the truth of language [is] conceived to exist "prior to" any subject', if not in an ontological sense than at least in a cognitive one.^[*Ibid*., p. 124.] At the point of composition, then, Prynne is faced with a pre-existing philosophical vocabulary which is the product, over millennia, of the very process of abstraction which 'A Note on Metal' seeks to chart: 'A Note on Metal' is, in other words, a text which attempts to describe the conditions of possibility of its own terminology. The word 'substance'---as with every other word used in the text---may therefore be seen not only as a tool with which to grasp an object, but also as an object in itself. From this perspective, Prynne's choice of this particular term signifies something concrete about the anti-idealist trajectory of his argument. The consequences of this position will be discussed in more detail at the end of this section in relation to the work of the philosopher Quentin Meillassoux; to lay the foundations for this discussion, however, it will first be necessary to clear up some of the more obvious factual and argumentative gaps in the text.

*2. In ¶2, Prynne states that '[t]he differences between the kinds of intent supporting the movement of bluestones from Pembrokeshire to Wessex, and the Sumerian acquisition of tin from Cornwall or Bohemia, must be obvious.' It is not immediately clear why it must.*

Since the publication of 'A Note on Metal', a number of important archaeological discoveries have been made concerning both Bronze Age cassiterite (tin ore) mining in Asia and the origins of the Stonehenge bluestones, casting doubt on the models accepted by Prynne. Most notably, evidence has emerged of mining in what are now western Afghanistan and southern Turkey, potentially stronger candidates for the source of Sumerian tin than either the Czech Republic or Britain, while modern chemical analysis has strengthened an existing theory that the bluestones were transported from Wales to Wiltshire by glacial action rather than by deliberate human effort.^[James D. Muhly, 'Sources of Tin and the Beginnings of Bronze Metallurgy', *American Journal of Archaeology*, 89.2 (April 1985), pp. 275--91; K. Aslıhan Yener, 'Managing Metals: An Early Bronze Age Tin Production Site at Göltepe, Turkey', *The Oriental Institute News & Notes*, 140 (1994), pp. 1--4; Rob Ixer, Richard Bevins and Nick Pearce, 'Stonehenge rhyolitic bluestone sources and the application of zircon chemistry as a new tool for provenancing rhyolitic lithics', *Journal of Archaeological Science*, 38.3 (March 2011), pp. 605--22.] These discoveries do not, however, affect the fundamentals of Prynne's comparison, and may in fact help to clarify it. Prynne is not primarily concerned with the particular geographical regions from which materials were sourced, or even with the distances involved in transporting them from source to destination, but rather with 'the kinds of intent supporting the movement' (¶2). In the case of Stonehenge, the intent, whether astronomical or ritual---and whether the stones were transported all the way from Wales or from a more proximate location---is singular: the stones were sourced, moved and arranged for a specific reason, and could not easily have been used for anything else. Sumerian tin, by contrast, is implicated in a qualitatively more complex web of intentions, some of which may ultimately have been ritual (the production of bronze ornaments, for example), but many of which would have been commercial or proto-commercial and would have involved extensive logical chains: the acquisition of *x* in order to make *y*, which can then be traded for *z*, etc. In describing the 'obvious' difference between the two phenomena, Prynne means to point out how these differing intentions are determined fundamentally by the materials in relation to which they operate. Tin is a material which facilitates the abstraction of property through alloying; stone is not.

*3. Prynne's central concern in ¶3 with the shift from 'the history of substance (stone)' to 'the theory of power (metal)' is preceded only by a very brief and potentially insufficient account of how '[t]he new quality of spiritual transfer was concentrated in [the] most durable forms of leading edge'.*

The point here is similar to that which was at stake in the previous paragraph. Having described the various uses to which forged metal might be put---ploughshares, arrowheads, fishing hooks---Prynne asserts that '[t]he new quality of spiritual transfer was concentrated in these most durable forms of leading edge, seen especially in the flattened motive of ornament' (¶3), before using this to support his theory of a general shift from substance to power. Part of the obscurity of this statement derives from the specialist sense of the word 'motive', which is used---as it is by V. Gordon Childe, whose work provides one of the key spurs for 'A Note on Metal'---as a synonym for or variant spelling of 'motif' (see *OED* definition 7^['motive, *n*.', *OED Online* (Oxford University Press, 2015), \<http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/122712\> [accessed 18 March 2015].]). Even more confusing, however, is the phrase 'quality of spiritual transfer': this is the first appearance of the word 'spirit' in the text, and, as with 'transfer', it is not at all clear in what sense it is being used. A reading of the following paragraph helps to illuminate this passage. Here, Prynne shifts the focus of the piece back to stone, and refers to certain activities specifically as 'extension[s] of the body' (¶4). Importantly, he implies the existence of a number of different types of extension whose characteristics are determined by the directions in which they point relative to the subject---inward (as 'ego-terms') or outward (towards 'enemies or animals hunted for food' [¶4], etc.)---and which reflect these characteristics back on to the materials that they employ. 'Spiritual transfer' can, then, be seen as another term for bodily extension, also described as 'persistence through material transmutation' (¶4). When used in relation to metal, it serves to emphasise the phenomenological sense in which subjectivity is always bound up with its objects: having developed tools of unprecedented power and effectiveness, humans in some sense *become* those tools, as well as the abstracting processes through which they are produced.^[This attitude carries echoes of Martin Heidegger's famous discussion of equipment and its 'readiness-to-hand' in Part One, Section III.15 of *Being and Time*, trans. by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1962), pp. 95--102.] '[D]urable forms of leading edge' (¶3) not only represent the pinnacle of then-current technological development but also, having been invested with spiritual content, help to determine future development.^[As in much of Prynne's work, there is a potentially comic or satirical reading which exists alongside or underneath the more straight-faced interpretation given above. This rests primarily on the use of 'leading edge', one of a number of apparently anachronistic terms in the text. Appearing in the late 19th century as a term in nautical engineering and extending in the 20th century to aviation, 'leading edge'---along with its evolved version, 'bleeding edge', for 'beyond leading edge'---is now more familiar as a piece of high-tech jargon, referring to '[t]he forefront or vanguard, esp. of technological development' ('leading edge, *n*.', *OED Online* (Oxford University Press, 2016), \<http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/106611\> [accessed 1 March 2016]). Its use in relation to ploughshares and bodkins may thus be interpreted as a deliberate puncturing of contemporary pretensions to technological sophistication and progress---Harold Wilson's famous 'white heat'---and, by extension, as a jab at the artistic and poetic avant-garde's implicit mimicking of such debased narratives. That Prynne intended to use the term in this way is, however, far from clear. The earliest such usage given by the *OED* comes as late as 1977, and while it is possible to dig up earlier examples they are extremely rare. In *The Times* throughout the entirety of the 1960s, the term is used almost invariably in an aeronautical or other industrial-scientific sense. The only instances in which it does not refer to an actual, physical edge are a description of the American University of Beirut as 'a leading edge for modern education in the Middle East' and a job advert titled simply 'THE LEADING EDGE: | COMPUTER PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT' ('A century of U.S. influence on Arab education', *The Times* [11 October 1966], p. 11; advert, *ibid*. [29 August 1969], p. 23).] 

*4. In ¶5, Prynne claims that '[t]he threshing of millet or barley must bring a "purer" and more abstract theory of value; the mixed relativism of substance leads, by varied but in outline predictable stages, to value as a specialised function and hence as dependent on the rate of exchange.' Again, it is not clear that the various parts of this statement follow necessarily from each other.*

This sentence is formed of two parts: a blunt, demonstrative clause followed, after the semicolon, by a more closely argumentative statement purporting to explain what goes before it. Obscurity is fostered by the use of logical markers such as 'must' and 'hence' in close proximity to highly technical phrases such as 'the mixed relativism of substance', the meaning of which is not clearly explained. In order to clarify Prynne's argument, it is necessary to look closely at what distinguishes the activity of threshing from other pursuits, principally hunting and fishing, that have already been described. The reference to threshing follows a description of how systematic agriculture---facilitated by new metal tools---'produces the idea of *place* as the chief local fact' (¶5), situating communities in fixed geographical spots and making long-term local activities such as mining practicable. Threshing, by which cereal grains are separated from their chaff, is even more specifically local than agriculture in general, requiring a specially flattened and hardened threshing floor; crucially, it is also extremely labour-intensive, 'absorb[ing] as much as a quarter of agricultural labor input' prior to mechanisation in the 19th century.^[Gregory Clark, *A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 286.] This combination of factors creates a relatively novel situation in which humans spend large amounts of time creating value (in the form of edible grains) through a more or less stationary, repetitive activity. This is at the heart of Prynne's argument about threshing: that the relative complexity of the process and its insertion in a long chain of other processes---sowing, harvesting, milling, etc.---directly encourages the development of 'a more abstract theory of value' (¶5), perhaps even an implicit labour theory of value. By 'the mixed relativism of substance' (¶5), then, he is referring to the fungibility, or at least comparability, of properties such as hardness (metal) and edibility (grain) that emerges from complex processes such as alloying and flour production, while 'value as a specialised function' is the term that mediates these properties through 'the rate of exchange' (¶5).

*5. Prynne appears to suggest in ¶6 that trade routes expanded* as a function of *the development of numerable metal currency. This view is potentially controversial both for factual reasons (as a result of its emphasis on the role of early coinage in foreign trade) and for what it seems to imply about technological development and human agency.*

Having described the development of techniques of casting and stamping bronze, which result in the production of coins standardized by weight and design, Prynne offers the following observation: 'In consequence, trade-routes undergo a dramatic expansion, since mercantile theory operates with the most conspicuous success when employed over large inter-cultural distances' (¶6). He then quotes a passage from Childe: 'In the Early Bronze Age peninsular Italy, Central Europe, the West Baltic Coastlands, and the British Isles were united by a single system for the distribution of metalware, rooted in the Aegean market.'^[V. Gordon Childe, *The Prehistory of European Society* (London: Cassell, 1962), p. 166.] Confusingly, this quote and the statement of Prynne's that precedes it bear no obvious relation to each other. Using the phrase 'Early Bronze Age', Childe is referring to a period unambiguously *prior* to the development of stamped coinage described by Prynne, which did not emerge until *c*. 700 BC at the earliest. Further obscurity is created by the citation at the end of the previous paragraph of an article by C.M. Kraay which seems directly to contradict Prynne's argument.^[C.M. Kraay, 'Hoards, Small Change and the Origin of Coinage', *Journal of Hellenic Studies*, 84 (1964), pp. 76--91.] As Prynne summarises Kraay's thesis, which is supported by an analysis of the distribution of coins between numerous extant hoards, '[e]ven in the case of early Greek coinage [...] the original intention was not so much in the first place to facilitate trade (external or internal), but rather to establish a system of centralised national wealth which could support a professional military caste' (n. 3). This knot cannot be untied as easily as those previously discussed, unless Prynne's emphasis in the piece's final paragraph on indeterminacy---'[i]f we are confident over the more developed consequences, at the unrecognised turn we are still at a loss to say where or why' (¶9)---can be taken as a quite serious admission of ignorance and a declaration of openness to multiple explanations, of which Kraay's is one. Even then, it would seem strange to provide practically no evidence for one's own theory while shoring up a competing narrative in the endnotes. Ultimately, as with much else in this text, the statement that follows Prynne's confident '[i]n consequence' must be taken on trust. Even then, however, the teleology of the argument requires further analysis. Prynne is not claiming here that coinage was developed *in order to* facilitate trade; on the contrary, his theory is that 'inter-cultural' trade boomed *as a result of* the development of coinage and 'mercantile theory' (¶6). This is an important aspect of the argument in 'A Note on Metal', recalling the earlier emphasis on materials as vessels for 'spiritual transfer'; for Prynne, metal is not merely a passive object shaped by a pre-existing human will, but rather the motor and determinant of human will itself.^[This is perhaps the inverse (or the equivalent from a reversed perspective) of James Lovelock's view of humanity as nothing more than an element in a chemical reaction: 'Our mistake when we started the Anthropocene was to fail to notice that inadvertently we were the catalyst of the reaction between the carbon of coal and the oxygen of the air' (James Lovelock, *A Rough Ride to the Future* [London: Allen Lane, 2014], p. 10).]

*6. At the end of ¶8, Prynne associates 'the technique of [the] removal' from 'presence as weight' with the emergence both of 'a complete middle class' and of 'an exilic (left-wing) history of substance'. It is not obvious what he means by either of the latter two terms, or how they relate to each other.*

By this stage of the piece, it is relatively clear what Prynne means by 'the remov[al]' from presence as weight' (¶8)---this is the tendency that has been described throughout 'A Note on Metal', according to which technological developments in metallurgy encourage value to be constituted in a series of increasingly abstract forms, culminating (for the time being) in bimetallic systems of stamped metal coins. Yet what follows this is more obscure: Prynne seems to set up a new, explicitly political distinction between a 'middle class' and an 'exilic (left-wing) history', describing the two as being in 'contrast' (¶8). Perhaps the most important stumbling block here is historical: having just described developments in currency during the reign of Croesus (595 -- *c*. 547 BC), Prynne's use of the terms 'middle class' and 'left-wing' is apt to seem highly anachronistic, even if their emergence is qualified as merely 'possible' (¶8)---this is, indeed, a central issue with 'A Note on Metal', which will be discussed in more detail below. The most plausible definition of 'middle class' in this context is a relatively strict economic one: Prynne is obviously not referring, in the modern British sense, to an organic combination of professionals and other white-collar workers with elements of the labour aristocracy, but rather to a class similar to that which Marx describes as manipulating 'merchant's capital' in historical eras prior to capitalism's dominance of the mode of production.^[Marx's analysis of 'Historical Facts about Merchant's Capital' in Chapter 20 of the third volume of *Capital* makes clear that this form of capital existed as far back as 'Carthage, Rome, and later among the Venetians, Portuguese, Dutch, etc.' (Karl Marx, *Capital*, 3rd vol., ed. by Friedrich Engels, in *Marx/Engels Collected Works*, 37th vol. [New York: International Publishers, 1998], p. 330).] As for 'left-wing', the term's immediate context---'an exilic (left-wing) history of substance'---suggests that it refers to a narrative about the past produced in the present, rather than to the essence of past social structures or other forms of life: a phenomenon need not be left-wing itself for it to be included in a left-wing history. Nevertheless, there is a further implication contained in the apparent anachronism of both terms. By inserting these essentially social terms into a profoundly non-social, material account, Prynne seems to make a claim to be more materialist than any existing brand of political analysis, notably Marxism. The history of all hitherto existing society may be the history of class struggle, but the history of all class struggle is the history of stone and metal. Crucially, Prynne's history is 'exilic', and thus presumably to be differentiated from the long process of collective solidarity and struggle that more commonly goes under the name 'left-wing'. In fact, the term 'exilic' specifically recalls his contemporaneous quotation to Riley of Shelley's description of the 'great sandy desert of politics', across which Prynne suggests they should journey as 'honourable Beduins'.^[Prynne to Riley, 15 September 1967.] The real question, then, consists of two parts: (a) what does Prynne understand an 'exilic (left-wing) history of substance' actually to be? and, (b) is 'A Note on Metal' an attempt to write, or at least to begin to write, this history?

Blanton provides a lucid response to the first part of this question in the course of a summary of Prynne's argument:

> With the advent of metal, significance no longer resides strictly in objects, and substance accordingly begins to forget its own terrestrial origins. [...] The qualitative hegemony of metal, however, does not fully eclipse the substantiality of stone, but rather complicates and even sublates it. Indeed the power of economy relies on its capacity to preserve substance as a sedimented concept or ground, as a sort of historical unconscious against or across which power implicitly measures itself. [...] Beneath economy and within it, then, lies what Prynne terms 'an exilic theory of substance' (127)---the intermittent possibility of a return to stone and a resistance to power, a refusal of wealth and all the structures of capital which it will ultimately imply. The attempt to remember a writing older than monetary circulation or the commodity, a writing which itself recalls older regimes of signification, offers an Archimedean critical point outside of economy, a position from which to induce, perform, or merely conceive modernity's end.^[Blanton, p. 130.]

Following John-Joseph Goux, Blanton argues that 'the gesture to an origin of economics or an origin of capital fatally undermines the hegemonic notion of the symbol'---a left-wing history of substance consists precisely in the performance of this gesture.^[*Ibid*.] But is this performance actually undertaken by Prynne in 'A Note on Metal', or does he merely gesture towards a gesture? On this point, Blanton is equivocal, describing 'poetry'---particularly Prynne's---as 'an index to the history of substance', but neglecting to state explicitly whether or not 'A Note on Metal' is a member of this category.^[*Ibid*., p. 131.] It is certainly true, and was pointed out at the beginning of this discussion, that the text is included in a book titled *Poems*, a status afforded to none of Prynne's other prose works except the fictional '*Plant Time Manifold* Transcripts' which follow *Wound Response* (1974). On the other hand, it would be premature to assume, as Chaganti seems to, that the simple fact of being published in this book makes 'A Note on Metal' a 'prose poem'---taken to its logical extreme, this line of reasoning would assign a similar status to the author's note or the index of first lines.^[Chaganti, p. 48.] This dilemma can be avoided entirely by denying, or at least modifying, the premise of Blanton's argument: that a left-wing history of substance is to be found only in poetry. In fact, 'A Note on Metal' does not contain a single reference to poetry. Blanton's claim appears to rest on the fact that Prynne is, by common consent, a poet, and that he must therefore be committed to this form above all else. Yet it might be countered that he is many other things, among them a teacher and, as it is part of the mission of this thesis to emphasise, a writer of prose. It is true that 'A Note on Metal' was first published in a context in which most of the prose was focused, explicitly or otherwise, on the question of what sort of poetry English poets should be producing in the mid-to-late 1960s---certainly this was the implicit focus of Riley's 'Working Notes on British Prehistory', to which Prynne was, in part, responding.^[As Riley puts it, '[a] theme that something existed in the life of man, *as* the life of man on this island up to about 1500BC at the latest, that we've lost sight of and need to reconsider. That we cd get it back is a thought that frightens with its possibilities. That we could recover something of our inheritance *without* anachronism, through if anywhere this thing I hold now, discourse' ('Working Notes on British Prehistory, p. 48). The collective pronoun here refers to the readers of and contributors to *The English Intelligencer*.] Nor is it necessary to deny that Prynne's conception of the role of poetry is an unusually far-reaching and ambitious one. The point is simply that to restrict the notion of an 'exilic (left-wing) history of substance' to what is conventionally deemed poetry is both unjustifiable based on the text of 'A Note on Metal' itself and implicitly contradicted by Prynne's own comments to Riley on the role of prose, as discussed earlier in this chapter.

The specific character of 'A Note on Metal'---particularly the teleology of its argument---may be clarified through an unlikely comparison with Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's argument in the penultimate chapter of their influential 2000 work *Empire*. Titled 'Generation and Corruption', this chapter attempts to chart two opposing forces that structure life under 'Empire', the authors' term for the prevailing system of postmodern global rule. Generation is described as 'a collective mechanism or apparatus of desire', and again as 'the *primum* of the biopolitical world of Empire.'^[Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, *Empire* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000), pp. 388--89.] It is a force associated with the multitude, the key subject and driver of Hardt and Negri's model, and functions as the 'basis and motor of production and reproduction.'^[*Ibid*., p. 389.] Corruption, on the other hand, is generation's 'simple negation': 'Corruption breaks the chain of desire and interrupts its extension across the biopolitical horizon of production. It constructs black holes and ontological vacuums in the life of the multitude that not even the most perverse political science manages to camouflage.'^[*Ibid*.] When Hardt and Negri move to consider the specific forms in which corruption manifests itself, a clear terminological parallel with 'A Note on Metal' emerges, centred particularly around the words *power*, *value* and *abstraction*. Corruption, they claim, is 'the sign of the impossibility of linking power to value':

> when capitalism loses its relationship to value (both as the measure of individual exploitation and as a norm of collective progress), it appears immediately as corruption. The increasingly abstract sequence of its functioning (from the accumulation of surplus value to monetary and financial speculation) is shown to be a powerful march toward generalized corruption.^[*Ibid*., pp. 390--91.]

*Power* and *value* seem to carry different meanings in *Empire* from those in 'A Note on Metal'; indeed, they switch places almost exactly. What is important is the congruence of the broader arguments in which the terms are deployed. Just as, for Prynne, the 'theory of power' is an intermediate form in the development of metallurgy which is inevitably superseded by a 'theory of value', for Hardt and Negri value is a concept proper to capitalism, which is 'by definition a system of corruption' and in which the latter will always ensure value's eventual abandonment by power.^[*Ibid*., p. 391.] The structural similarity of these lines of argument may help us to develop an understanding of the political message of 'A Note on Metal' which goes beyond mere primitivism or a movement of chronological 'reversal' of the sort described by Chris Nealon in a recent consideration of Prynne's poetry and prose---an understanding which the text's final paragraph seems to encourage, but which it does not fully explicate.^[According to Nealon, 'Prynne's ambition is towards a poetry that would stage cognition's ability to reverse time and, in doing so, reach past mere metaphor [...]. Prynne has imagined pitting reversal or undoing against what he takes to be the historical damage of modernity'. Nealon makes clear that 'a belief in this ability organizes Prynne's essays as well as his poems', giving 'A Note on Metal' as a specific example (Chris Nealon, 'The Prynne Reflex', in *The Claudius App*, 4 [2013], \<http://theclaudiusapp.com/4-nealon.html\> [accessed 26 March 2015].]

One of the most characteristic aspects of *Empire* is its focus on forward movement, for want of a better term: rather than advocating a retreat into localism in the face of the globalizing forces of capital, Hardt and Negri encourage contestation on the terrain of globalization itself. In the world conjured up by *Empire*, as in Marx, ever-increasing capitalist development simultaneously impoverishes humanity and brings into being both the conditions for capitalism's supersession and the subject that will enact that supersession---for Marx, the international working class; for Hardt and Negri, the multitude. Yet this is not a vulgar accelerationism in which the intensification of Empire's processes and systems of control will lead inevitably to its downfall; or at least, if it is inevitable, it is an inevitability which *includes* the co-operative actions of the multitude. Far from being uncritical technophiles racing headlong into an uncertain future, as some contemporary critics suggested, Hardt and Negri lay great stress on existing modes of solidarity and organisational techniques. Indeed, the book's concluding passage, which attempts to describe the 'militant' of the future, draws direct comparison with the methods both of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a.k.a. 'the Wobblies', an organisation which has been active since 1905, and of St Francis of Assisi.^[Hardt and Negri, pp. 412--13. The authors' concern with specifically linguistic corruption in Chapter 4.2 and their extended engagement with Augustine's *City of God* in Chapter 4.3 suggest further points of comparison with Prynne, though the uses to which 'the city' is put in *Empire* differ significantly from those of *Kitchen Poems* or *The White Stones*.] Does this historicizing tendency in *Empire* correspond in any meaningful way with Prynne's attention to a potential left-wing history of substance in 'A Note on Metal'? If so, could the orientation of Hardt and Negri's argument---towards the future in a movement that parallels but does not simply follow the processes of Empire and global capitalism---also shed light on the orientation of Prynne's text? One aspect of 'A Note on Metal' that has not yet been fully examined is the importance which the text accords to history, both as a word and as a concept. 'A Note on Metal' is, self-evidently, a work of history itself, though this may not be its only function. It is also a text which *seeks* a history, the 'exilic (left-wing) history of substance' referred to so extensively above. Importantly, Prynne deliberately counterposes the concepts of *history* and *theory*, most obviously at the end of the third paragraph, where 'the history of substance (stone) shifts with complex social implication into the theory of power (metal)' (¶3), but also in the reference to the '"purer" and more abstract theory of value' (¶5) brought into being by threshing. A theory is, in a basic sense, the forward- or present-facing counterpart of a history: a descriptive structure which attempts to account for a phenomenon while remaining open to potential falsification. For Prynne it seems to be coded negatively, signifying the increasing abstraction which it is the main purpose of 'A Note on Metal' to chart, a position which would restrict the text to something like Nealon's simple backwards/forwards schema. But does history need to be backwards-facing? On one level, it obviously does; yet 'a history', no matter how exilic, is also something which underlies and moves at the same speed as the present. In an ideal world, history and theory meet and mutually inform each other *in* the present; in 'A Note on Metal', however, this correspondence is ruptured by theories of power and value which have deliberately forgotten their past. So, to return in a modified form to a question asked above: is the text an attempt to excavate this history?

'A Note on Metal' seems to be a provisional attempt to excavate an 'exilic (left-wing) history of substance', but one which acknowledges that the task of full excavation is out of reach of any one text. The clearest point of acknowledgement can be found in the final paragraph, in which Prynne appears to retract---or at least to qualify---much of the foregoing argument. Having set out an eminently linear historical narrative, he now declares that this is not enough: a real history would not be 'a simple decision that any one movement is towards ruin' (¶9). Importantly, however, Prynne does not take this opportunity to declare the impossibility of such a history. While he acknowledges that 'at the unrecognised turn we are still at a loss to say where or why' (¶9), he refuses to hypostatize this loss as some sort of fundamental characteristic of modernity or of the human condition in general. That an 'exilic (left-wing) history of substance' is hinted at but not fully investigated by 'A Note on Metal' can be seen even more clearly by assessing the text against Prynne's own criteria for prose, as communicated to Riley shortly after the piece's first publication in the *Intelligencer*. Discussing the passage from Shelley referred to earlier in the context of an argument about the role of prose, Prynne claims that 'the pathos of Shelley's tract, noble as it is, urgently has to be re-written for us now, with all the hormonal sophistication of birth-control & modern demography.' The emphasis here is on continuity: not a crude 'updating' of *A Philosophical View of Reform*, but an effort to break out of short-term political thinking through the identification of parallels between 1820 and 1967, with the ultimate aim of laying bare deeper historical forces. Yet this sort of 're-writing' is something which 'A Note on Metal' deliberately forgoes. As mentioned above, the piece's context implies relevance to a community of poets in late-1960s England, but the text's actual history stops in the ancient world. Prynne spends eight paragraphs describing several thousand years of developments in materials from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, but offers only the most brief and suggestive account of how these developments relate, for example, to currency as it exists in the mid-to-late 20th century, and no account at all of how modern materials such as plastics might fit into or challenge this history.^[Prynne's explicit subject is, admittedly, metal; still, this does not prevent him from offering a detailed account of metal's relationship with stone.] 'A Note on Metal' is, quite literally, a prehistory, both in the conventional sense of dealing with the prehistoric era, and to the extent that it constitutes a necessary prelude to the more comprehensive re-writing that Prynne wishes to see.


## vi. Conclusion

In the fourth chapter of 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', Sutherland provides a detailed account of the later stages of Prynne's relationship---intellectual and personal---with Charles Olson. Through a reading of the correspondence and the later poems of *The White Stones*, he suggests that Prynne's response to Olson's 1953 prose work *The Mayan Letters*, reissued by Jonathan Cape in 1968, demonstrates a fundamental difference between the two poets' conceptions of history. *The Mayan Letters* consists of letters from Olson to Robert Creeley, written during a stay in Mexico and largely concerned with the immediate apprehension of Mayan civilisation as a sort of pre-lapsarian state, to which modern society might return through an act of poetic will. As is typical for Olson, despite its historical subject matter and its engagement with primary sources---in this case, Mayan hieroglyphs---the text deliberately eschews all the trappings of academic history. As Sutherland puts it, describing the pamphlet *The Special View of History* (1970), when Olson writes about history '[h]e means nothing about which we can speak very precisely, and this is part of what he does mean.'^[Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 189.] Sutherland goes on to describe Prynne's poem 'Bronze : Fish', which he takes to be a direct response to *The Mayan Letters*, as 'a poetic argument for strictness and accuracy and against Olson's "negative" capacity to romanticise archaic cultures in disregard of scholarship.'^[*Ibid*., p. 192. For concrete examples of Prynne's emphasis on accuracy in scholarship, cf. above, p. ??, n. 156.] This distinction between Prynne and Olson, and the positive light that it sheds on Prynne's attitude to history, bears directly on 'A Note on Metal'. One of the key points that Sutherland uses to distinguish Prynne from Olson is the former's emphasis on a history which persists, without fundamental breaks, from the time of the historical object right up to the moment of composition. Whereas 'Olson excavates back and down into a world which is the contrary of modernity', Prynne remains committed to a theory of continuity, however obscure and unrecognised. Nevertheless, Prynne's position is also characterised by a deep lack of certainty, an antipathy to settled and self-satisfied pronouncements about the relationship between past and present, especially when made in the form of vatic utterances; this is precisely the scepticism which, as was shown above, emerges in the final paragraph of 'A Note on Metal'. Sutherland derives a political content from this stance, describing it as

> a conscious refusal of specificity, on the grounds perhaps that both Pound's and Olson's seizure of specific cultural formations as the condition of unity led respectively to fascistic and egregious forms of mythologisation of the heroic modern individual. Prynne's vagueness is thus a calculated form of resistance to political error, as well as a resistance to the "tweezers and tropic catalogues" of academic forms of rationality cut off from any general purpose or general understanding of their place in the world.^[*Ibid*., pp. 195--96.]

For Sutherland, then, Prynne is both a proponent of accuracy and an opponent of specificity, depending on the exact context of each work. As the contours of a text like 'A Note on Metal' make clear, Prynne is prepared to deploy all the resources of conventional historical scholarship where they stand a real chance of revealing something about our relation to the past, but he is careful to steer clear both of pedantic scholarship-for-scholarship's-sake and of grand Olsonion/Poundian leaps which reject academic rigour as a matter of myopic principle. This discussion will now move to consider Prynne's relationship to history, and to reality in general, on a more fundamental, philosophical level, attempting to clarify the position which has been described obliquely throughout this chapter through reference to the work of Quentin Meillassoux.

Some attention was paid at the beginning of this discussion to the distinctive philosophical vocabulary deployed by Prynne in 'A Note on Metal', and particularly to the term 'substance'. It was suggested that this word recalls the pantheism of Spinoza and the related idealism of Hegel, but that these perspectives are entirely incommensurable with Prynne's own, which emphasises the absolute exteriority and self-sufficiency of the object, a category which includes ostensibly human creations such as language. The key source for this attitude, particularly the latter part, is Prynne's 1961 text 'Resistance and Difficulty', a resumé of a particular branch of the philosophy of perception whose main strand of argument forms a dialogue with the American philosopher John Wild's 1959 article 'Contemporary Phenomenology and the Problem of Existence'.^[Prynne may have met Wild, or at least come into contact with the philosopher's work, during his short fellowship at Harvard, where Wild taught from 1927 to 1961. As Sutherland points out, the didactic portion of the essay also appears to have been heavily influenced by Herbert Spiegelberg's *The Phenomenological Movement* (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1959) (Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 107).] Wild's key aim in this article is to defend the status of what he sees as a form of direct, unmediated knowledge: 'The intentional act, together with its object, is immediately self-revealing to me, and there is a clear sense in which I have a privileged access to such intentions.'^[John Wild, 'Contemporary Phenomenology and the Problem of Existence', *Philosophy and Phenomenological Research*, 20.2 (December 1959), 166--180 (p. 171).] He also attempts to set up a distinction between reality and the imagination, taking 'resistance' to be a key marker of reality: 'A real being not only resists my overt acts and manipulations; it resists my acts of awareness as well. It reveals only a partial phase of itself in a perspective that constantly changes with my movements.' An object of the imagination, by contrast, 'is fixed, and lacks this openness to further points of view. Thus a piece of painted scenery does not continue to reveal itself as I move around it, but simply disappears.'^[*Ibid*., p. 174.] Imaginative objects are 'clear and distinct', while real objects are 'resistant'. It is this distinction with which Prynne takes issue. He begins by further distinguishing between 'resistance' and 'difficulty', the latter being the 'subjective counterpart' of the former: 'I experience difficulty when I encounter resistance.' In other words, 'difficulty is cognitively prior to resistance but ontologically dependent upon it.' Importantly, 'resistance itself comes nearer than any other differentiable quality to being completely inherent in the object'.^[Prynne, 'Resistance and Difficulty', p. 28.] He then demonstrates the 'viciousness' of a position like Wild's, which 'allows the external world only sufficient objective reality for the major dimensions of human living to be set up':

> "Self-conscious action" in the milieu described with such eloquence, as a primary source for the experience of existence, seems to point to a position where the external world's main value to the subject lies in the graduated difficulties that it can provide him with, and by means of which the subject can render himself and his actions fully intelligible. I do not discover much about the nature of water, if I require it only in order to realise my ability to swim; and if the attempt to reach an awareness of substance is thus prompted by the need for self-definition, then we must expect the contributions of the imagination to be set aside.^[*Ibid*., p. 29.]

Wild's stance is reduced to a sort of weak (in the intellectual sense) epistemological solipsism, albeit one which does not yet realise quite how alone it might be. Prynne then reintroduces the imagination, and by extension art, in a much more important role, claiming that they

> offer both the difficulty of contrivance and also a profound assurance that this difficulty corresponds to genuine resistance in the larger context of the outside world. It is the imagination's peculiar function to admit, draw sustenance from, and celebrate the ontological priority of this outside world, by creating entities which subsequently become a part of the world, an addition to it.^[*Ibid*., p. 30.]

Art objects---and, for Prynne especially, poems---become effective guarantors of a continued relationship between the subject and what lies outside it, between difficulty and resistance. Whether through actually creating new resistant material *ex nihilo* or through permanently transforming that which already exists---Prynne is not entirely clear on this point---art sets up the possibility of a real and logical channel between subject and object, as opposed to a potentially deceptive cocoon of mere difficulty.^[There are obvious similarities between this perspective and Prynne's opposition to 'meditative' Victorian poetry, as discussed in Chapter 1. On the issue of the creation or mere modification of resistant material, Prynne's paraphrase of R.P. Blackmur---that 'it is the function of poetry to *increase the sum* of the world's available reality' (*ibid*., p. 27; emphasis mine)---as well as his description of imaginative entities as 'additions' to the world, would seem to support the former, while the actual mechanics of poetic composition, in which pre-existing words are arranged in new patterns, tends towards the latter.]

Prynne's concerns and mode of argument in 'Resistance and Difficulty'---though not his conclusions---bear a striking resemblance to those of Quentin Meillassoux in his 2006 book *Après la finitude*, translated into English in 2008 as *After Finitude*. In this short work, Meillassoux takes aim at a stance which he terms 'correlationism', and which he takes to be the dominant perspective in contemporary philosophy, both continental and analytic. For the correlationist, 'we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other.'^[Quentin Meillassoux, *After Finitude*, trans. by Ray Brassier (London: Continuum, 2008), p. 5.] Meillassoux identifies this as an explicitly post-Kantian attitude designed to avoid the pitfalls both of pre-critical metaphysical dogmatism and of subjective idealism. Its effect, however, is to keep the subject locked in what he terms, after Francis Wolff, a 'transparent cage':

> correlationism readily insists upon the fact that consciousness, like language, enjoys an originary connection to a radical exteriority (exemplified by phenomenological consciousness transcending or as Sartre puts it 'exploding' towards the world); yet on the other hand this insistence seems to dissimulate a strange feeling of imprisonment or enclosure within this very exteriority [...]. Consciousness and its language certainly transcend themselves towards the world, but there is a world only insofar as consciousness transcends itself towards it.^[*Ibid*., p. 7.]

It is not difficult to see the similarities between Meillassoux's description of correlationism and Prynne's critique of Wild, for whom 'the external world's main value to the subject lies in the graduated difficulties that it can provide him with'.^[Wild provides a description of his own position which accords completely with Meillassoux's description of correlationism: 'The phenomenologist is simply one who is not content with the object alone or the subject alone, but who is concerned with the two in their intentional integrity, *as they always are actually found*' (Wild, p. 169, emphasis mine).] Meillassoux goes on to reveal what Prynne would call the 'viciousness' of the correlationist view by means of a thought experiment. Proposing an object accessible to science but which predates all human life, which he terms 'the arche-fossil'---examples include 'an isotope whose rate of radioactive decay we know, or the luminous emission of a star that informs us as to the date of its formation'---Meillassoux shows how a consistent correlationism is necessarily barred from making meaningful statements about the pre-human past which such an object apparently reveals.^[*Ibid*., p. 10.] Despite making conventional concessions to science in everyday discourse, the correlationist cannot finally think the origin of the correlation, the emergence into being of givenness. The correlationist will, claims Meillassoux, always add an implicit 'codicil' to statements about the arche-fossil: 'event Y occurred x number of years before the emergence of humans---*for humans* (or even, *for the human scientist*).'^[*Ibid*., p. 13.] As Prynne asks in 'Resistance and Difficulty', 'can the world---in its full and detailed substantiality---be said to have existed *for me*, before my knowledge of it?'^[Prynne, 'Resistance and Difficulty', p. 28.] The answer, for the strict correlationist, must be that the world can *only* be said to have existed for me, and not in itself.

It is necessary, at this point, to offer a clarification not made by Meillassoux himself, but which has important implications both for the nature of the correlationist circle and for the status of the arche-fossil. Meillassoux's designation of the arche-fossil as an object which precedes all human life is one of the most memorable aspects of the book; nevertheless, as Graham Harman points out, the arche-fossil 'is not an argument.'^[Graham Harman, 'Meillassoux's arche-fossil is not an "argument"', *Object-Oriented Philosophy* (6 March 2014), \<https://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/meillassouxs-archefossil-is-not-an-argument/\> [accessed 12 June 2015].] Rather, it is a provocative thought experiment, designed to raise a problem which it will be the task of the remaining chapters to analyse, and to raise it in the most effective and convincing manner possible. This strategic aspect has a tendency to bleed into the main stream of Meillassoux's demonstrations. Thus, in a recapitulation of his argument at the beginning of Chapter 3, he describes how correlationism 'institutes a certain kind of solipsism, which could be called a "species solipsism", or a "solipsism of the community", since it ratifies the impossibility of thinking any reality that would be anterior or posterior to the community of thinking beings.'^[Meillassoux, *After Finitude*, p. 50.] This is certainly the implication of the arche-fossil as Meillassoux presents it; yet there is no reason to believe that real correlationism would fare any better in dealing with an arche-fossil that predated only the present thinking subject, a situation which would lead to a more familiar form of solipsism. Meillassoux seems to oscillate between these two perspectives, which are really just a stronger and a weaker version of each other. Thus, in the short paper 'Time without Becoming', he describes how '[a]ppeals to intersubjectivity are of no account [against the arche-fossil], since the time in question is not the time preceding such and such an individual---this time is still social, made up of the subjective temporality of ancestors---but a time preceding all life, and so every human community.'^[Meillassoux, 'Time without Becoming', conference paper presented at Middlesex University (8 May 2008), \<https://speculativeheresy.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/3729-time\_without\_becoming.pdf\> [accessed 12 June 2015].] However, it is clear from the argument of *After Finitude* that a truly strong correlationism is unable to appeal to intersubjectivity for anything more reliable than representations anyway. In fact, Meillassoux admits in an endnote to the first chapter that the arche-fossil anterior to all human life was preferred to one merely antedating the subject because it avoids a seeming 'loophole', through which the correlationist might argue that 'one's individual birth and death occurs within a time which is woven from intersubjectivity---the time of the community of consciousnesses, which means that to be born and to die is to be born and to die for other consciousnesses, and hence to be deployed in a becoming which is once more reducible to its givenness for a community of egos.' Yet as Meillassoux rightly points out, 'this rejoinder is a desperate sophism, which reduces emergence and perishing to whatever the other perceives of it.'^[Meillassoux, *After Finitude*, pp. 130--31, n. 12.] For strong correlationism, 'the other' is as inaccessible as the in-itself. As such, there is no essential difference between an arche-fossil from 13.5 billion years ago (the date given by Meillassoux for the origin of the universe), one from 1900 (the birth date of the world's oldest living person at the time of writing) or one from 1990 (the present author's own year of birth), as long as it is anterior to the presently thinking subject. This will be important to bear in mind in the discussion of Prynne below.^[For an engagement with the the issues that surround the strict version of Meillassoux's arche-fossil---or at least a similar set of issues---it is possible to turn to Prynne's reading of the Anglo-Austrian physicist Wolfgang Rindler. According to Rindler, two types of 'horizons' exist in any theoretical model of the world: an event-horizon, beyond which events are in principle unobservable by any given observer; and a particle-horizon, which describes the same situation with reference to particles. 'If a model possesses an event-horizon *and* a particle-horizon', writes Rindler, 'then for any observer originally attached to a given fundamental particle there exists a class of events absolutely beyond his cognizance, no matter how he journeys through space' (W. Rindler, 'Visual Horizons in World Models', *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*, 6 [1956], 662--77 [p. 673]). Writing to Ed Dorn in 1972, as Justin Katko points out, Prynne extends Rindler's theory by adding an 'inference-horizon': 'If we infer logically the existence of what we cannot observe then the inference horizon exceeds the event horizon by the limits of logical extensibility' (Prynne to Dorn, 25 April 1972, quoted in Justin Katko, 'Relativistic Phytosophy: Towards a Commentary on "The *Plant Time Manifold* Transcripts"', *Glossator*, 2 [2010], 245--94 [p. 282]). Treating the technical concept of observability loosely, we might say that the strictly pre-human arche-fossil sits beyond the event- and particle-horizons of our world, but within the bounds of what Prynne terms the inference-horizon.]

Following the book's provocative introduction, Meillassoux spends the remainder of *After Finitude* in a painstaking effort to penetrate the 'correlationist circle' and to gain access to the 'great outdoors' which lies outside contemporary philosophy's transparent cage.^[*Ibid*., p. 7.] Like Prynne's, his attempt is to some extent an 'inside job', accepting the premises of his opponent before adding a new term which completely reconfigures the situation; unlike Prynne's, it is strictly rationalist in character. The details of his argument, which relies largely on the counterintuitive implications of absolute contingency, are, however, of less interest in the present context than his reasons for making it. Meillassoux sees the main problem with correlationism not in the theory itself, but in what its abdication of responsibility for the absolute makes room for: a new fideism. For the strong correlationist, reason has no more privileged access to the absolute than does faith---any claim to such access is equally valid. This tendency is referred to by Meillassoux as the 'religionizing of reason', and he sees it as having operated ever since the Enlightenment's first critiques of religious dogmatism.^[*Ibid*., p. 47. Meillassoux's stance is to be distinguished from the superficially similar position of Adorno and Horkheimer insofar as it is profoundly undialectical and does not hold that '[m]yth is already enlightenment' (Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, ed. by Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, trans. by Edmund Jephcott [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002], p. xviii). Nevertheless, Meillassoux is far from being a 'New Atheist' of the Richard Dawkins variety, making sure to emphasise that 'the religionizing of reason does not designate the act of faith as such---since the latter can obviously prove extremely valuable' (*After Finitude*, p. 47).] He demonstrates how, in the modern era, philosophers as diverse as Wittgenstein and Heidegger have allowed fideistic elements into their work, giving Levinas's conception of 'the wholly other' as a paradigmatic example of 20th-century religionized reason.^[*Ibid*., pp. 43--48.] Meillassoux's opposition to fideism seems, at the very least, to be structurally analogous to Prynne's antipathy towards the supposedly direct historical access represented by Olson's *Mayan Letters*. Whereas for Meillassoux what needs to be countered is the attitude which accords legitimacy to protestations of faith precisely to the extent that they disavow claims to reason, for Prynne it is a lazy position which assigns a privileged epistemological status to the poet while evacuating the latter term of meaning: the poet *just has* access to the essence of Mayan civilization, without having to do any (or having to do only minimal) poetic work. It is clear, however, that the two situations are not exactly the same. In fact, it is necessary at this point to distinguish between two separate comparisons between Prynne and Meillassoux, which are not entirely compatible. In 'Resistance and Difficulty', Prynne takes aim at a philosophical position that falls into the broad category of correlationism, with the aim, like Meillassoux, of reopening a channel to the 'great outdoors' of reality; in his comments on Olson, as described by Sutherland, he expresses scepticism about an attitude to history comparable to what Meillassoux characterises as fideism. Yet for Prynne these two undesirable positions do not seem to exist in a toxic relationship of complementarity-in-difference. It is not the case that John Wild's stance leaves a gap which is filled by Olson's; or at least, if it is, this is not the line taken by Prynne. Indeed, the solution to the problem of correlationism provided in 'Resistance and Difficulty' seems, at first glance, closer to fideism than to Meillassoux's 'speculative materialism'---it is certainly difficult to imagine the latter, for all his commitment to poetry, being satisfied by such a simple move.^[Meillassoux's two book-length publications subsequent to *After Finitude*---*Le Nombre et la sirène* (2011) and *Métaphysique et fiction des mondes hors-science* (2013)---both concern literature.] Equally, the predominant 'tweezers and tropic catalogues' approach to history opposed by Prynne can hardly be considered a form of correlationism, its disjunction from reality being a function of its academic self-absorption rather than a deliberate epistemological stance.

This clarification of Prynne's twin positions offers a new way of looking at his task in 'A Note on Metal'. On the one hand, it is a text which does real historical work based on archaeological evidence, and which refuses to claim some sort of poetic position automatically superior to the academic books and articles which are cited in its endnotes. This is the level on which the text was approached in the early stages of this reading, accepting its claim to empirical knowledge and testing that claim against more recent evidence where necessary. On the other hand, 'A Note on Metal' *is* in some sense a poetic work. The argument for considering the text as a 'prose poem' based on its publication in *Poems* was dismissed earlier as overbroad; nevertheless, the very fact that 'A Note on Metal' is so regularly confused with a poem is itself suggestive, and means that it does differ from something like the book's index of first lines. The word 'note' in the title of such a hugely ambitious text must be consciously ironic, but it is also a key term for Prynne, deployed to describe other prose works---'A Pedantic Note in Two Parts', *Field Notes*---as well as the poem 'First Notes on Daylight', which is roughly contemporaneous with 'A Note on Metal'. For Prynne, the note is a form whose apparent modesty also implies flexibility and freedom from the more teleologically determinant aspects of academic rationality, while maintaining some of the more useful, lower-level aspects: scholarly accuracy, concern for references, and so on. Like reports in *Notes and Queries*, Prynne's notes are freed from the formal and argumentative imperatives of the full-length journal article or the scholarly monograph; yet unlike such reports, they make use of this freedom to head in a direction of their own. If 'A Note on Metal' is to be read accurately, it must be read not only as a work of history, but also as one of those 'entities which subsequently become a part of the world' which are described in 'Resistance and Difficulty'---that is to say, as a poem.

The poem, for Prynne, is perhaps something like a reverse arche-fossil. Whereas Meillassoux's arche-fossil is an object completely external to humanity which is nevertheless recuperable by science (it is this recuperability which creates problems for correlationism), the poem---a category which includes 'A Note on Metal'---is a man-made object characterised by its having become at least partially *un*recuperable: once written, it is a resistant piece of the external world, whose essence can never be entirely captured by hermeneutics. An important consequence of this view in the present context is that the poem thereby becomes part of history, a data point on the same ontological plane as any other piece of historical evidence.^[Like other objects, the poem thus has facticity in the sense emphasised by Meillassoux.] 'History' is a word with at least two meanings: it designates both the object of historical enquiry---in the most basic sense, facts about the past---and, as 'a history', the process of recovering, synthesising and recounting those facts, i.e. the act of historical enquiry itself. 'A Note on Metal' is history in both senses, and the careful and deliberate nature of its textual construction suggests that it is aware of this status. This is true not only of 'A Note on Metal' as a whole, but of each of its constituent parts, right down to individual words. We thus return to the phenomenon by which the text is a sort of index of itself, described earlier as an attempt to make clear the conditions of possibility of its own terminology. In being simultaneously a history and a poem---in other words, resistant, requiring an effort of interpretation, not self-effacing or aiming at transparency like a more conventional piece of historical discourse---'A Note on Metal' is something different from epic, in which the poem merely *includes* history as its object. It is precisely here that Prynne's 'exilic (left-wing) history of substance' can be found. Paradoxically, it is only when the text is read as history and nothing more that this deeper history appears 'exilic': when it is grasped in its full substantiality, as history *and* poem, it appears clearly, not as the object of the text but as the substance from which every word is formed, as well as the animating principle behind their configuration.^[This distinction recalls that between Bateson's alleged conception of the text as inert historical object and Leavis's conception of it as living historical being, as discussed in Chapter 1.] It is as if 'A Note on Metal' was an impossible sort of coin, one side of which precludes access to its obverse, while the other allows both to be viewed at once. What, then, does it actually take to view the text, and history as such, from this privileged angle?

Having described Prynne's concern for historical accuracy in contradistinction to Olson's great leaps, Sutherland introduces a further, qualifying term. For the Prynne of *The White Stones*---or at least of the majority of the poems in that collection, excluding a few which significantly postdate 'A Note on Metal'---accuracy can never be completely sufficient; indeed, it must sometimes be held in check. Referring to a prior reading of the poem 'In Cimmerian Darkness', as well as Prynne's frequent use of the trope of 'the city' for 'some other version of this | present age', Sutherland describes how

> it is precisely the prerogative belonging to our real *auctoritas* to imagine that in the other world, "the city," our accuracy would be immediate and not a matter of conscious resistance of error; and furthermore that we can make a true gesture toward that condition only by suspending the characteristically modern need to be accurate at the moment when the condition itself, the city, seems nearest to the imagination.^[Prynne, 'In Cimmerian Darkness', in *Poems*, pp. 74--75; Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 198.]

The temporary suspension of accuracy in this world is the condition for accuracy in the next, which is actually just another version of here. Yet it really is only a *condition*: unlike Olson's active mysticism, Prynne's is profoundly passive, emphasising patience and trust rather than the poet's uniquely active and accurate penetration of the mysteries of being. From this perspective, it is possible to return to the unexpectedly lyrical concluding sentence of 'A Note on Metal': 'If we are confident over the more developed consequences, at the unrecognised turn we are still at a loss to say where or why' (¶9). That Prynne ends the text with this affirmation of our lack of knowledge, figured as a spatial condition---'at a loss'---is highly significant. Not only does he downplay our accuracy about specifics ('where'), but he also suggests a serious lack of coherent teleology in the foregoing argument, at least when read simply historically ('why'). The purpose of this statement, far more than a belated protestation of humility, is perhaps to effect or at least to encourage some form of the 'swing across into | some other version of this | present age', manifested in this particular case by a shift from the historical to the poetic-as-historical levels of the text. Only with this final acknowledgement of ignorance, both on the part of Prynne and of the reader, does the text yield up its real meaning.
