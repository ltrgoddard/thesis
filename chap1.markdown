# Chapter 1. 'The contemporary situation here in England'


## i. Introduction

When the most basic and accessible introductions to Prynne's work seek to identify his influences, the two figures who appear more than any others are the British poet Donald Davie, one of Prynne's academic supervisors, and the American poet Charles Olson, with whom Prynne corresponded throughout the 1960s.^[Jeremy Noel-Tod, 'Prynne, J. H. (Jeremy Halvard)', in *The Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry*, 2nd edn, ed. by Ian Hamilton and Jeremy Noel-Tod (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), \<http://www.oxfordreference.com\slash view\slash 10.1093\slash acref\slash 9780199640256.001.0001\slash acref-9780199640256-e-961\> [accessed 15 December 2014]; 'Prynne, J. H.

Prynne', *The Poetry Foundation*, \<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/jh-prynne\> [accessed 15 December 2014]; 'J. H. Prynne', *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*, 3 July 2014, 07:56 UTC, \<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J.\_H.\_Prynne&oldid=615398780\> [accessed 15 December 2014].]  Yet the relationship between the citations is in most cases highly unequal. Prynne's entry in *The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature* is characteristic: 'His first collection, *Force of Circumstance and Other Poems* (1962; later suppressed), bore similarities to Donald Davie's gently modernist Movement poetry, but his subsequent involvement in the British Poetry Revival exposed his work to the legacy of American Objectivism, particularly Charles Olson, and shifted it in a more experimental direction.'^['Prynne, J.H.', in *The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature*, 4th edn, ed. by Dinah Birch and Katy Hooper (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 574.]  Leaving aside the misleading reference to the 'British Poetry Revival'---a term coined by Eric Mottram and more often associated with London-based poets involved with the Poetry Society in the 1970s---the dual purpose of this sentence, epitomised by the casually parenthetical '1962; later suppressed', is clear: to acknowledge the importance of Davie to Prynne's early poetry while cordoning off the later work, safely insulating it from any implication of further influence.^[Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival 1960--1975', in *New British Poetries: The Scope of the Possible*, ed. by Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), pp. 15--50.]  Unlike Olson, Davie is only 'gently' modernist; Prynne, meanwhile, is a sort of poetic negative who is 'exposed' to the blinding light from across the Atlantic and thereby fundamentally 'shifted', never able to return to his previous form. Prynne's implied designation of his debut collection as juvenilia, excluding it from every volume of his collected poems up to and including the recent third Bloodaxe edition, is in this way accepted as a factually correct literary-historical judgement rather than a highly contentious attempt at personal canon-formation, and figures associated with the work---not only Davie, but also Charles Tomlinson---are consigned to the same ash heap.^[Prynne, *Poems*, 3rd edn (Tarset: Bloodaxe, 2015).]

If basic reference works downplay Davie as an influence, the more sophisticated scholarly perspective on Prynne's poetic development moves him even further out of view. Despite the relative infancy of academic work on Prynne, a number of clear conventions can already be discerned. One of the most important of these is the view that Prynne's 1971 collection *Brass* marks a significant shift---perhaps the most significant shift---in his poetic development. As Sutherland notes in his own 2004 account of the book, '[a]ll published accounts of *Brass* are agreed on one point: as Ian Patterson says, "Brass ... is a transitional work."'^[Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 238; Ian Patterson, '"the medium itself, rabbit by proxy": some thoughts about reading J.H. Prynne', in *Poets on Writing, 1970--1991*, ed. by Denise Riley (London: Macmillan, 1992), 234--46 (p. 237). This conception has recently been confirmed by Prynne himself, who has noted that '*Brass* was a distinct break with its precursor practise' (Prynne, 'The Art of Poetry No. 101', interviewed by Jeff Dolven and Joshua Kotin, *The Paris Review*, 218 [Fall 2016], 174--207 [p. 191]).]  He goes on to cite Reeve and Kerridge's *Nearly Too Much*, which as the first widely available, book-length study of Prynne's work has exerted a strong influence on subsequent reception, as well as David Trotter's *The Making of the Reader* (1984), which Sutherland describes as '[p]erhaps the most influential account' of the shift.^[Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 238.]  Sutherland himself disagrees at length with the specifics of these accounts, but he does not dispute the substantive point that a change took place in Prynne's work, arguing instead that it can be detected as early as *The White Stones* (1969). Whether or not this second shift in Prynne's work is attributed directly to his loss of contact with Olson and the latter's subsequent death, and whether it occurs neatly between *The White Stones* and *Brass* or runs like a fault line through the former collection, it has the effect of relegating the work of the early 1960s from the position of subordinate term in a binary hierarchy to effective invisibility within a model of Prynne's career that is formally ternary but is in critical practice still composed of two parts: early and mature.^[Arguing against Anthony Mellors, Sutherland takes a version of the latter position, further disagreeing with Reeve and Kerridge over the precise character of the break (Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', p. 175, n. 329). Davie, for his part, seems to locate a break somewhere within the pages of *Brass*; having written confidently about much of *The White Stones*, he claims in 1973 that 'The Ideal Star-Fighter' is 'the only one of [Prynne's] recent poems which I think I understand' (Donald Davie, *Thomas Hardy and British Poetry* [London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1973], pp. 177--78).]  More recent investigations into what has been described as Prynne's 'late style'---notably a special edition of the journal *Hix Eros* compiled following a symposium on the topic in 2013---threaten to push this work even further into obscurity.^[*Hix Eros: On the Late Poetry of J.H. Prynne*, ed. by Joe Luna and Jow Lindsay Walton (Brighton: Hi Zero and Sad Press, 2014).]

Davie is not the only figure to suffer from the lack of scholarship on Prynne's work in the first half of the 1960s: with notable exceptions such as Steve Clark's highly polemical 'Prynne and the Movement', there appears to be a general bias against consideration of indigenous influences in work on Prynne's early career.^[Steve Clark, 'Prynne and the Movement', *Jacket*, 24 (November 2003), \<http://jacketmagazine.com/24/clark-s.html\> [accessed 27 November 2014].]  It is true that Prynne has described the poetic climate during his school and college years as 'a kind of wasteland', and it would of course be misleading to insist that his intellectual relationship with, say, Charles Tomlinson is as significant to the development of his poetry and prose as his relationships with Olson and, later, Ed Dorn.^[Prynne, 'A Dialogue with Nicholas Royle'.]  Nevertheless, it is important to recognise the extent to which the prevailing scholarly focus on the transatlantic bridge represented by Prynne's contact with the latter two figures is conditioned by what are essentially archival contingencies---notably, the presence of hundreds of letters from Prynne to Olson and Dorn in a well-known and easily accessible collection at the University of Connecticut.^[By contrast, Prynne's correspondence with Tomlinson is only partly represented by the small collection at the University of Texas's Harry Ransom Center, with at least some letters from Prynne remaining in private possession.]  It is possible to hazard a general law of modern literary history, according to which physical distance between poets---with its concomitants, greater reliance on written correspondence and a stronger tendency to prize and therefore preserve letters received---tends to promote the visibility of the relationship in subsequent scholarship. The opposite case clearly applies to Davie, with whom Prynne must have had dozens of meetings which have left no written trace, aside from the brief reference to 'conversations with J.H. Prynne' in the acknowledgements to Davie's 1964 book on Ezra Pound.^[Davie, *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964), p. vi. In all the various collections of Davie's papers, the only clearly identified material relating to Prynne is a single 1973 letter held at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.]

If a reliable account of Prynne's entire career is eventually to be produced, the bias described here will need to be rectified, or at least compensated for. The following chapter will therefore concentrate directly on the very earliest years of Prynne's career, beginning with his matriculation at the University of Cambridge in 1957. It will examine his relationship with Davie in detail, comparing it with the equivalent relationship between Davie and Charles Tomlinson and considering the effect on Prynne of Davie's involvement with the Movement, the poetic group anchored by Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis. It will then make a more extended case for a third significant influence that has so far gone almost entirely unacknowledged: F.R. Leavis.


## ii. Donald Davie and Charles Tomlinson

Though this chapter will argue that Donald Davie was an extremely important figure during Prynne's early years at Cambridge, he was not a permanent fixture. Prynne matriculated at Jesus College at the beginning of the 1957--58 academic year, a period in which Davie was a visiting professor at the University of California. Only the following year did Davie return to Cambridge, where he had completed his undergraduate studies and Ph.D. in the late 1940s and early '50s respectively, and it was not until 1959 that he was made a fellow of Gonville and Caius College.^[Neil Powell, 'Davie, Donald Alfred (1922--1995)', *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), \<http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/60078\> [accessed 6 November 2014].]  Alex Latter describes how Prynne's transfer to Davie's supervision was the result of direct lobbying by Prynne and R.F. Langley, a fellow student on the English course at Jesus and later an important poet in his own right.^[Alex Latter, '"Essential news": a history of *The English Intelligencer*' (unpublished doctoral thesis, Birkbeck College, University of London, 2013), pp. 100--01. Latter attributes this story to Peter Riley and notes that it has been corroborated by Rod Mengham (email to the author, 2 February 2014).]  Though the dates for the move are unclear, it seems likely, given Davie's academic position and the structure of the Cambridge English Tripos, that he only supervised Prynne for the third and final year of the course, known as Part II. Even so, in order to catch Prynne's attention as a potential supervisor, some sense of Davie's basic scholarly and poetic approach must already have filtered down to him. Before examining Prynne's recorded comments on Davie, it may therefore be helpful to sketch a brief outline of the older poet's public image in the mid-to-late 1950s, to give an idea of the sort of figure that Prynne and Langley hoped to encounter.

Writing in the postscript to the 1976 reprint of *Articulate Energy*, Davie describes his first book of criticism---1952's *Purity of Diction in English Verse*---as 'a thinly disguised manifesto'.^[Donald Davie, *Articulate Energy: An Inquiry into the Syntax of English Poetry* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1976), p. ix.]  A glance at the book's introduction makes clear what he means: having described the 'peculiar discomfort' felt when reading verse whose language is 'impure', he goes on to claim that while '[t]his criterion is not equally relevant to all sorts of English poetry or in all phases of the English tradition', it is 'relevant, indeed indispensable, to the poetry of Goldsmith's contemporaries, and to that of my own.'^[Davie, *Purity of Diction in English Verse* (London: Chatto & Windus, 1952), p. 2.]  The polemical purpose of *Purity of Diction* is evidently to legitimise through literary-historical reference Davie's own restrained, broadly anti-modernist poetic practice in this period---'taking sides', as he tentatively puts it, 'with Pope and Yeats and perhaps Auden, against Pound and perhaps Eliot.'^[Davie, *Articulate Energy*, p. ix. In fairness, Davie is referring here not to his own actual tendencies, but to what he felt was expected by those 'who were kind enough to read the two books one after the other, and to read my poems too' (*ibid*.). His later sympathies with the modernist project are well-known.]  This unabashedly conservative attitude is typical of what led Davie to be categorised, in a 1954 *Spectator* leader article that has become a staple of critical accounts, as a member of the Movement.^['In the Movement', *The Spectator* (30 September 1954), pp. 21--22.]  Yet despite being included in both of this nascent grouping's seminal anthologies---D.J. Enright's *Poets of the 1950s* (1955) and Robert Conquest's *New Lines* (1956)---it was clear that Davie's poetry was never as representative of the tendency as that of, say, Larkin, Amis or John Wain. This fact was raised in 1957 in a blistering review of *New Lines* by Davie's former student, Charles Tomlinson, who noted that 'Mr. Davie's close association in the public mind with the middlebrows ("the Wain-Amis-Davie school", *The Listener* calls the new poetry) is [...] difficult to account for.'^[Charles Tomlinson, 'The Middlebrow Muse', *Essays in Criticism*, 7.2 (April 1957), 208--17 (p. 213).]  In 1959, Davie raised this implicit divergence to the level of a public break with his short essay 'Remembering the Movement', which denounced the whole thing as a sort of publicity exercise, though one of which the key participants claimed strenuously to be ignorant.^[Davie, 'Remembering the Movement', in *The Poet in the Imaginary Museum: Essays of Two Decades*, ed. by Barry Alpert (Manchester: Carcanet, 1977), pp. 72--75.]  Perhaps most tellingly, the dustjacket of his next full-length collection, which comprised poems written between 1957 and 1963, declared that '[i]n these poems Donald Davie abandons certain features of his writing which have attracted notice in his earlier volumes. In particular he now eschews for the most part the use of irony, nostalgia, and literary allusions.'^[Davie, *Events & Wisdoms* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1964), [dustjacket]. Despite being published by the Marvell Press, Davie's 1959 *The Forests of Lithuania*, a version of *Pan Tadeusz*, was also decidedly un-Movement.]

A reading of one poem from the book, 'Housekeeping', will show how necessary the qualification 'for the most part' is to this description. For one thing, the poem is absolutely nostalgic in tone. Davie begins abruptly with the chronological locator 'From thirty years back', describing a childhood scene of 'my grandmother with us boys | Picking the ash-grimed blackberries'.^[Davie, 'Housekeeping', in *Collected Poems* (Manchester: Carcanet, 1990), p. 104.]  To recall an event from childhood is not automatically to be nostalgic---nevertheless, Davie's tone as the poem progresses makes clear that this is the mode in which it is to be read. The poem's central subject is Davie's grandmother's migration from Somerset to Yorkshire in the 1890s: how '[s]he toiled, my father a baby, through the hard | Fellside winters, to Barnsley'. This is expressed through the conceit of the characteristic noises she makes while picking blackberries having 'carried' across the distance between the two counties, and subsequently through time to Davie as speaker: 'Contentment cries from the distance. How it carries!' Describing how his grandmother was '[t]ranslated in youth past any hope of returning', Davie brings this very 'hope' into play, presenting the distance between his Barnsley childhood and his present condition (Davie wrote the poem while living in Italy) as analogous to that between the West Country and northern England.

It would, however, be misleading to characterise 'Housekeeping' as a simple expression of *Heimweh*, though this is undoubtedly one of its roles. The poem is also a vehicle for Davie's own self-presentation, a function which is fulfilled through the strategic use of a certain narrative tone---if not quite 'ironic', then certainly urbane and knowing. This tone can be detected most clearly in the poem's third stanza:

> \singlespacing How the sound carries! Whatever the dried-out, lank  
Sticks of poor trees could say of the slow slag stealing  
More berries than we did, I hear her still down the bank  
Slide, knickers in evidence, laughing, modestly squealing.

\noindent The most obtrusive aspect of this stanza is the concluding clause, in which the speaker deliberately collides two equally patronising images of the poem's subject: Davie's grandmother squeals like a pig, but 'modestly', as befits a family matriarch who spent the prime of her life in 'the 'nineties'. The phrase nevertheless succeeds in distancing the speaker from his grandmother, playing into the poem's broader purpose: to allow Davie, well-known poet and Cambridge don, to celebrate his provincial origins while reassuring his audience that he has transcended them, and crucially that they do not exert any involuntary influence on his poetic work. 'Housekeeping' is definitely nostalgic and potentially ironic. Does it also infringe Davie's third ban, on the use of literary allusions? According to Davie's own comments during a 1963 reading at the University of Cincinnati, it does. Introducing the poem, he reveals that it 'has quite a close relation to a specific poem among those [...] by Boris Pasternak, which I was translating at the time.'^[Davie, 'A Reading of His Poems' (reading, University of Cincinnati, 29 March 1963), \<http://drc.libraries.uc.edu\slash bitstream\slash handle\slash 2374.UC\slash 696768\slash Elliston\_Donald\_Davie\_03--29--63\_A\_Track\_07.mp3?sequence=15\> [accessed 16 December 2014].]  Davie is referring to the poems which form the concluding section of Pasternak's novel *Doctor Zhivago*, of which his translation was published in 1965.^[Davie, *The Poems of Doctor Zhivago* (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1965).]  Far from being an invisible link, and thus not strictly an allusion at all, this relation is presumed by Davie to be visible (with some prompting) to his audience: 'Those of you who know Pasternak's *Doctor Zhivago*, with the poems at the end in the of course inadequate translation, may like to ask yourselves which of Pasternak's poems it was that sparked this one off as far as I'm concerned.'^[Davie, 'A Reading of His Poems'.]  'Housekeeping' is certainly not representative of *Events & Wisdoms* as a whole, but neither is it completely anomalous, and the fact that it fails so obviously to conform to what is presumably Davie's own description of the volume---a collection which 'eschews for the most part the use of irony, nostalgia, and literary allusions'---suggests a real gap between his ambitions and his poetic achievements in this period. This analysis is confirmed in startlingly blunt terms by a November 1958 entry in Davie's personal journal. Having recounted a conversation with George MacBeth in which 'modern Franco-American poetic' was dismissed, Davie makes the ambivalent nature of his own position clear: 'I come round to thinking that [...] many of the sincerely self-professed champions of poetry are in fact its worst enemies. My own prolonged schizophrenia---between [Yvor] Winters on the one hand, Pound & Tomlinson on the other---at this point enters on a crucial phrase.'^[Davie, 'NOVEMBER 14th, 1958'.]

On returning to Cambridge in 1958, then, it seems fair to say that Davie was in a liminal position, having shifted away from the Movement in intention but having not yet confirmed this shift in practice or in considered public statement. The most fertile source of information on Prynne's attitude to Davie is his correspondence of the 1960s---not only the letters to Olson and Dorn, but also those to Peter Riley, as well as three short airmail letters sent to Cid Corman in 1961. By the same token, the collation and comparison of comments made to diverse correspondents sheds light on the differences in these relationships, and on Prynne's approach to letter-writing itself. Prynne's earliest remarks about Davie come in a November 1961 letter to Corman, in the context of a sustained comparison of the English and North American poetry scenes, to the detriment of the former. Having enquired in an earlier letter after potential American contributors to *Prospect*, the little magazine which he had recently taken over from Elaine Feinstein and Tony Ward, Prynne laments the 'total collapse of a singable idiom' in England, which has encouraged the emergence of '[d]ecorous poltroons on all sides: small, cautious and dead.' After praising Charles Tomlinson's work as 'truly the nearest to stirrings', Prynne seems to consign Davie to the 'poltroon' category: 'Just look at Davie's recent *A Sequence for Francis Parkman*---such muscle-bound gesticulation is rife. Look at Gunn.' The collocation with Thom Gunn is particularly telling, suggesting that Prynne did not consider Davie's poetic work of the late 1950s and early '60s to have shifted as decisively from its Movement origins as Davie himself did. Yet even at this early stage, there is a sense of obligation to the older poet---in an asterisked note to the above comment, Prynne acknowledges that 'Prospect will have to carry a review [...]---pressures inherited that I can't side-step.'^[Prynne to Cid Corman, 19 November 1961. It is worth noting that *Prospect* did not, in fact, carry a review, which would in any case have seemed irrelevant by the time the magazine finally appeared in 1964.]  It is not immediately obvious what Prynne means by 'muscle-bound gesticulation', though the phrase bears a resemblance to his 1962 condemnation of 'the deliberately small aims and over-developed musculature of most English writers of verse'.^[Prynne, 'from a letter', *Mica*, 5 (Winter 1962), 2--3, 28 (p. 3). 'Muscle' is not always a negative term, however---writing to Dorn having just composed 'The Wound, Day and Night', Prynne claims that 'I begin to feel like a muscle-man, and the relief of *for the first time* some confidence in the profession' (Prynne to Dorn, 26 January 1966). In another letter to Dorn from 1964, he writes admiringly of the 'muscular ease' of the Australian novelist Patrick White's prose (Prynne to Dorn, 21 December 1964).]  It is perhaps relevant that *A Sequence for Francis Parkman* is Davie's most explicit attempt to bridge the transatlantic gap that Prynne was himself struggling with in this period, its dedicatee being the celebrated nineteenth-century author of *The Oregon Trail*. Writing in a note to the sequence in his 1972 *Collected Poems*, Davie describes it as 'my response to North America on my first visit', and the overall tone is one of simultaneous fascination and alienation.^[Davie, *Collected Poems, 1950--1970* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1972), p. 303.]  In the sequence's final poem as published, a verse letter to the Yeats scholar Curtis Bradford, Davie asks a series of questions about American history before admitting that he can 'only guess, | I guess at it out of my Englishness | And envy you out of England.'^[Davie, 'A Letter to Curtis Bradford', in *Collected Poems* (1990), 98--99 (p. 99).]  A further poem, added to the sequence in the collected edition but not present in the original book, is even more forceful in its self-hating Englishness (or Britishness): 'Anglophobia rises | In Brooklyn to hysteria | At some British verses. | British, one sympathizes.'^[Davie, 'For Doreen. A Voice from the Garden', in *ibid*., pp. 99--100 (p. 100).]  It seems possible that Prynne's antipathy towards the sequence stems not from its misdirected energy, as might be the case with some of Davie's earlier work, but from its anaemic, small-island handling of subject matter explored so much more vitally by poets such as Dorn and Olson. Davie has poetic muscles of a sort, but he is using them simply to gesticulate rather than to deliver the knock-out punch.^[Whatever his antipathy towards the sequence in 1961, Prynne did at least send a copy to Dorn, suggesting a certain level of interest (Dorn to Olson, 3 March 1965).]

Prynne's next comment on Davie, in an April 1962 letter to Dorn, is much more positive: relaying Davie's approval of Dorn's *The Newly Fallen*---'I don't know when I enjoyed reading a collection of poems so much as Edward Dorn's'---Prynne describes it as 'an encouraging comment from an academic of such intelligence and standing as him.'^[Prynne to Ed Dorn, 29 April 1962. In an interesting slip, Prynne refers to *The Newly Fallen* as '*For the Unfallen*', the title of a 1959 collection by Geoffrey Hill.]  While this change might cynically be attributed to Prynne's hopes of securing a fellowship at Caius in the following months (he was, with Davie's help, elected fellow of Caius in October 1962), it might equally result from the structure of the letter: there would seem to be little point in relaying a compliment from somebody while simultaneously declaring them an idiot.^['Elections to Fellowships', *The Caian* (Lent 1963), p. 33. Latter, *Late Modernism and 'The English Intelligencer'* (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 239, n. 4.]  Prynne's next letter to Dorn, in July, helpfully clarifies the evident ambivalence of his position *vis-à-vis* Davie, contrasting the latter's declared critical stance in 'Remembering the Movement' with what Prynne sees as the still 'crippled' state of his poetry: Davie is presented---to use his own terminology---as a schizophrenic figure, apparently aware of what needs to be done in the new poetry of the 1960s but unable to do it himself. Prynne quotes Davie's characterisation of the typical Movement poet as 'never so surrendered to his experience, never so far gone out of himself in his response, as not to be aware of the attitudes he is taking up', writing that 'Davie's own writing is crippled with this sense of the larger social context, his desire to include all his reservations within the scope of what small conviction he can command.'^[Davie, 'Remembering the Movement', p. 74.]  He admits that Davie 'has visions of the nobility of the poet's responsibility', giving 1959's *The Forests of Lithuania* as an example, but contends that 'he cannot see this as other than an interpreter's function---to speak out and make plain what is true of the public context in which we live.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 9 July 1962.]  It is odd to see Prynne seeming to deny that 'the public context in which we live' is a legitimate subject for poetry when his next collection, *Kitchen Poems* (1968), would deal directly with the human subject's imbrication in the very public contexts of global finance and politics. It is probable, therefore, that he means something different by the phrase; perhaps something similar to the debased sociality to which Davie admits paying tribute through 'inert gestures of social adaptiveness---"no doubt", "I suppose", "of course", "almost", "perhaps"'.^[Davie, 'Remembering the Movement', p. 72.]  This is absolutely to be distinguished from, for example, the metaphysical emphasis on 'discretion' in Prynne's 'A Gold Ring Called Reluctance', a poem which claims that '[t]he public | is no more than a sign on the outside of the | shopping-bag'.^[Prynne, 'A Gold Ring Called Reluctance', in *Poems*, 21--23 (p. 22).]  When we encounter the 'inert gestures' of 'Have | you had enough? Do have a little more? | It's very good but, no, perhaps I won't' in this context, they are very obviously shaded with sarcasm, whereas in Davie's poetry they retain their primary function as 'poetic socializing'---what John Press described in 1963 as 'vaguely reassuring gesture[s] intended to show that these highly intellectual poets want their readers to relax and feel at home in a genial atmosphere.'^[*Ibid*., p. 23; John Press, *Rule and Energy: Trends in British Poetry Since the Second World War* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), p. 47. A more apt ancestor to Prynne's technique can be found in the heavy irony of Pound's *Hugh Selwyn Mauberley*; for example, in the repetition of the conventional 'in any case' in Poem IV, which deals with casualties of the First World War: 'These fought in any case, | and some believing, pro domo, in any case . . .' (Ezra Pound, *Hugh Selwyn Mauberley* [London: The Ovid Press, 1920], p. 12).]

For Prynne in the early 1960s, Davie's receptivity to American poetry had its uses, particularly when combined with the public profile that he had earned in the course of the previous decade. Writing to Olson in November 1962, Prynne describes his plans---in retrospect too optimistic---to print Dorn's *Hands Up!* in England, noting that 'I have induced Donald Davie to like it, and he is a figure of such authority in these matters that we should be able to find a publisher without too much difficulty.'^[Prynne to Olson, 7 November 1962.]  Discussing the same subject with Dorn in December, he describes how the manuscript has been sent to the London publisher Routledge & Kegan Paul, 'since both I and Davie have had work published there and know the man in question [Colin Franklin].'^[Prynne to Dorn, 31 December 1962.]  In an extraordinary letter to Dorn earlier the same month, Prynne makes Davie's usefulness as a mouthpiece for American poetry explicit: 'He is an energetic propagandist, and has a chance of being heard (which I do not), so that a change of wind may be just possibly in the offing here; he has certainly singled out [Robert] Creeley's collection as one of the year's most exciting books in another piece he is doing for *The Guardian*.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 10 December 1962.]  The tone here is like a less direct and militaristic version of that adopted by Amis in his most mercenary letters during the ascendancy of the Movement, as when he wrote to Wain in November 1953 to summarise recent developments in the literary press, concluding that 'with you as general, the boys could move right into control.'^[Kingsley Amis, quoted in Zachary Leader, *The Life of Kingsley Amis* (London: Random House, 2013), p. 284.]  Further evidence of a coordinated PR campaign is provided in an April 1963 letter to Dorn, by which point Prynne had abandoned hope of placing *Hands Up!* with Routledge:

> \singlespacing So I now have my eye on Eyre & Spottiswoode, who have published American verse and would also be interested in the novel [*The Rites of Passage*]. I am waiting for Donald's return from Cincinnati (this week) to plan another set of tactics, and hope you will bear with the delays. [...] Meanwhile Donald (with prompting) will I trust continue to scatter hints in the forum, like this one in a *New Statesman* review of Spender's new and worthless book.^[Prynne to Dorn, 14 April 1963.]

\noindent Davie's review, a cutting of which is pasted into the letter, combines Movement-style antipathy towards Stephen Spender, Dylan Thomas and anyone else associated with the 1940s with enthusiasm for 'the theories of Olson and the poems of Creeley and Edward Dorn [which] seem to show the Modern Movement entering, in America, on a new lease of unexpected life.'^[Davie, 'Spender Struggling', *The New Statesman*, 65 (29 March 1963), p. 465.]

Despite Davie's evident willingness to cooperate in the promotion of Olson and Dorn to English readers in the early 1960s, Prynne's tone when referring to him is frequently patronising. In the 10 December letter referred to above, Prynne writes of Davie as if he is one of his students, complaining that 'he knows almost nothing of what is really new in America at this time, but I am working steadily at him'.^[Prynne to Dorn, 10 December 1962.]  At other points, however, Prynne admits to a certain respect for his former supervisor. Writing to Olson at around the same time as he is coordinating the Eyre & Spottiswoode campaign, Prynne refers to Davie as 'a colleague and a close friend of mine here', and by 1965, after Davie had secured Dorn a teaching post at the new University of Essex, he is ready to describe him as 'the most intellectually and personally honourable man I've ever met in the knowledge industry (or the adjacent masquerades). I owe him much more than I can easily say, even though we don't really know each other very well and he has a certain robust sense of distance'.^[Prynne to Olson, 24 April 1963; Prynne to Dorn, 17 June 1965.]  This ambivalence is maintained throughout the decade. Writing to Peter Riley in August 1967, Prynne makes a joke about Davie's irrelevance, declaring that 'Andrew [Crozier] must be in a complete mental haze if he thinks sending a copy [of a recent book] to Donald Davie would be interesting---maybe to the Sports Editor of *The Times* as well.'^[Prynne to Peter Riley, 9 August 1967.]  Yet when Davie makes his momentous move to the United States the following year, Prynne admits to Riley that 'I am very deeply torn apart [...] (most obscurely) by Donald Davie's translation to Stanford Cal.'^[Prynne to Riley, 7 February 1968.]  Prynne's ambivalence towards Davie was described above as stemming from the aesthetic gap between the latter's poetic theory and his poetic practice; yet the tone of this last comment, not to mention Prynne's apparent confusion about his own position, suggests that something more may be at stake.

In order to clarify Prynne's poetic and academic relationship with Davie, it may help to compare it to Davie's superficially very similar relationship with Charles Tomlinson. Davie had supervised Tomlinson at the turn of the 1950s during his first stint at Cambridge. In a 1998 *Paris Review* interview, Tomlinson recalls that '[m]y final year at Cambridge was a compensation for my first. I acquired a new supervisor, a young man just returned from service at sea, and this was Donald Davie. We went on to educate each other and ultimately to criticize each other's verse.'^[Charles Tomlinson, 'The Art of Poetry No. 78', interviewed by Willard Spiegelman, *The Paris Review*, 149 (Winter 1998), \<http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1033/the-art-of-poetry-no-78-charles-tomlinson\> [accessed 17 November 2014].]  That Prynne enjoyed a similarly free relationship with Davie is suggested by an account of the activities of the Jesus College Literary Society, printed in the college's annual report for 1959. Prynne served as secretary of this society for the 1958--59 academic year, with his college tutor, the biologist and ethnomusicologist Laurence Picken, serving as president. Given that the report refers to Picken in the third person, it is likely that it was written by Prynne, and its tone is therefore of interest. Having recounted a number of the society's events for the year, the account describes how

> \singlespacing Dr [David] Daiches introduced the poetry of Wallace Stevens to an audience largely unacquainted with the extent of his work, and Dr Davie presented a most forceful case for the major stature of Ezra Pound's *Cantos* against the concerted reluctance of a section of the audience to admit anything of the sort. We hasten to reassure Dr Davie, however, that things may not be as bad as they must have seemed.^['The Literary Society', *Fifty-Fifth Annual Report* (Cambridge: Jesus College Society, 1959), 60--61 (p. 61).]

\noindent While brief, this account carries a clear sense of scholarly community: an implication, particularly in the gentle humour of the final sentence, that the undergraduate may speak on equal terms with the celebrated poet.

As noted above, Tomlinson's eventual break with Davie was public, though not therefore permanent. His attack on *New Lines*, titled 'The Middlebrow Muse', was printed in *Essays in Criticism* in 1957, the year that he was hired by the English department at the University of Bristol, where he would remain for the rest of his career. Writing from this relatively secure position---the preceding years had been spent travelling in Italy and teaching in a primary school---Tomlinson was apparently unhampered by professional squeamishness, attacking Conquest's anthology in no uncertain terms. As with many assaults on the Movement, one of Tomlinson's key targets is their apparent collusion with the popular press: he describes how 'the new type of poet' has been advertised in publications ranging from 'the *Times Educational Supplement* to the *Daily Express*', a spectrum calculated to shore up their characterisation as 'middlebrow'.^[Tomlinson, 'The Middlebrow Muse', p. 208.]  The anthology's contributors are then summarily dismissed: Wain is a purveyor of 'Hollywoodese', Amis a philistine, Gunn a wannabe tough guy, and Conquest lives up to his name by 'offer[ing] us in his own poetry a rather blatant parade of his sexual adequacy.' Enright is afforded lengthier consideration, but only the more forcefully to label him a 'journalist in verse'.^[*Ibid*., p. 210.]  Aside from some similarly dismissive comments about Larkin and Elizabeth Jennings, much of the rest of the review is devoted to considering how far Davie's work exceeds the bounds of the anthology, Tomlinson accusing Conquest of having selected the least interesting and most typically Movement-esque poems in order to construct a false harmony between the contributors. Davie is apparently 'the only poet in this volume whose work, after worrying signs of metrical restraint, promises a real development away from his earlier manner', though he is kept in his place as 'a good but minor poet'.^[*Ibid*., p. 213.]  Tomlinson ends up declaring that 'there is not a great deal in Mr. Conquest's anthology outside the range of an average talent with some leisure and within reach of an English faculty library', before concluding with a Leavisian lament over 'the gradual disappearance of objective values in our criticism.'^[*Ibid*., pp. 216--17.]

What is striking about Tomlinson's position in the context of this thesis is its effective mirroring of Prynne's own attitude to Davie. Where Prynne sees Davie as acknowledging in his prose---particularly in 'Remembering the Movement'---what he fails to break away from in his poetry, Tomlinson appears to view Davie's 'Movement-plus' poetry as a sort of unconscious vanguard for his critical work. The key to this difference is, perhaps, chronological: as a student of Davie's well before the publication of *Purity of Diction*, Tomlinson could regret his supervisor's initial absorption into the publicity machine of the Movement, whereas for Prynne the issue was always with his failure fully to leave it behind.^[As Prynne puts it in a recent interview, 'Davie wanted very much to be a poet. I think he probably knew in his heart of hearts that he actually wasn't a poet, though he cared enough about poetry to commit himself to substantial efforts to develop some way of expanding his own writing practise' (Prynne, 'The Art of Poetry', p. 178).]  Yet both positions are complicated by a further issue---namely, the uneasy involvement of Prynne and Tomlinson in the very processes of literary promotion and publicity that formed the basis of their antipathy towards the Movement. When 'The Middlebrow Muse' was published, it was followed by rebuttals from both Davie and Enright. Davie's effort relies, as in much of his criticism, on the vague insinuation of fascist sympathies: 'That sneer at "democratic" shows how far Mr. Tomlinson is from losing his nerve. He will run *any* risk, throw down *any* safeguard.'^[Donald Davie and D.J. Enright, '*New Lines* and Mr. Tomlinson', *Essays in Criticism*, 7.2 (April 1957), 343--45 (pp. 343--44).]  It is Enright's piece which deals the crushing blow. Having dismissed the tone of Tomlinson's review, with its 'confidently aped Leavisian and Lawrentian gestures', Enright undercuts him in the most effective way possible:

> \singlespacing Mr. Tomlinson applies the new sneer-word 'fellow-travellers' to two of the contributors. Yet, in the case of both of the anthologies mentioned, the editors received one unsolicited manuscript (which they felt unable to use)---from Mr. Tomlinson. Of course Mr. Tomlinson retains the right (which he has used, in America and in England) to review these same anthologies. But, in choosing his abuse, has he forgotten that he himself, in full knowledge of who his 'fellow-travellers' would be, once applied for a ticket?^[*Ibid*., p. 345.]

\noindent Tomlinson's criticisms of the Movement are effectively, if unfairly, painted as the *ressentiment* of a poetic also-ran. As Martin Dodsworth points out, it was almost certainly Davie who showed Tomlinson's poems to both Conquest and Enright in the first place, a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the review's ambivalent take on his work, viewing it as simultaneously hampered by the middlebrow *milieu* and trying to push beyond it.^[Martin Dodsworth, 'The Movement: Never and Always', in *The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary British and Irish Poetry*, ed. by Peter Robinson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 94--110 (p. 103).]

Prynne's relations with the literary world through Davie were more successful, and accordingly less dramatic. It is easy to identify at least three opportunities afforded to Prynne in the early 1960s for which Davie was, in all probability, at least partly responsible. The most obvious is the publication of Prynne's debut collection, *Force of Circumstance*, by Routledge in 1962. Davie's *A Winter Talent* had been published by the firm in 1957 and his critical work *The Heyday of Sir Walter Scott* in 1961. D.S. Marriott claims, without citation, that 'Davie was [...] responsible for drawing Prynne's manuscript of poems to the attention of his then publishers'.^[Marriott, p. 81, n. 8.]  Prynne's letter to Dorn of 31 December that year makes clear that he considered Colin Franklin, his contact at the firm, to be amenable to persuasion by poets already on their list. Given that Davie was willing to write to Franklin in support of Dorn, an American whom he had never met, it would certainly be odd if he refused to do the same (or more) for his own student.^[Prynne to Dorn, 31 December 1962.]  The second event which it seems reasonable to attribute to Davie is Prynne's delivery of a broadcast on the Third Programme in the same year. Subsequently printed in the BBC magazine *The Listener* as 'The Elegiac World in Victorian Poetry', the talk was originally broadcast at 8:45 p.m. on 15 December 1962 under the title 'The World of Elegy'. The *Radio Times* gives the following description: 'During the last hundred years elegiac poetry retired from the external world and created an inner meditative world of its own symbols. Mr. Prynne discusses in illustration some poems of Tennyson, Arnold, Eliot, and Wallace Stevens.'^[Schedule, *Radio Times* (13 December 1962), p. 13.]  Broadcasting on the Third Programme was in fact a relatively common activity for Cambridge dons in this period, as is amply demonstrated by contemporaneous schedules: Prynne's talk came on the same evening as a segment on 'Science and the Industrial Future' by D.B. Welbourn (Selwyn) and the previous day saw a talk by D.M. MacKinnon (Corpus Christi) on Martin Heidegger.^[Schedule, *Radio Times* (6 December 1962), p. 49. It would, however, be misleading to characterise the Programme's output as entirely academic; for a detailed account of the BBC's dealings with contemporary poets through the Third Programme, concentrating primarily on the 1940s and '50s, see Kate Whitehead, *The Third Programme: A Literary History* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989).]  Nevertheless, it seems likely that Davie---perhaps through his acquaintance with George MacBeth, then a Third Programme producer---would have had some hand in securing the opportunity for Prynne, who was after all a relatively unknown figure at this point. (Davie, by contrast, had appeared regularly on the Third Programme since the early 1950s. In February and March of 1962, he presented a four-part series on eighteenth-century poetry, while in the early months of 1963 his work was broadcast as part of a twelve-episode translation of the *Odyssey*.^[David Daiches, another of Prynne's potential supervisors at Jesus, was also a regular feature on the Third Programme throughout the 1950s and '60s.]) The last of Davie's potential attempts to insinuate Prynne's work into the London literary world is represented by a January 1964 interview conducted as part of the 'Poet Speaks' series by Peter Orr. Davie had himself been interviewed for this series in October 1960 (and was recorded again in November 1964), and the project was subsequently to be associated with Routledge through the publication of selected interviews in a 1966 volume edited by Orr.^[Peter Orr, ed., *The Poet Speaks: Interviews with Contemporary Poets* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1966). Prynne's interview was not included in this book.]

Prynne's interview is interesting insofar as it contains some unusually clear and concise statements of his poetic priorities in this period. Asked whether he considers poetry something to be 'dabbled with', he provides a response which seems to be aimed directly at those unreconstructed elements of the Movement which had persisted into the early 1960s:

> \singlespacing No, I think very much not to be dabbled with. I think this is probably one of the strongest feelings I have about it; one of the strongest feelings I have, indeed, about the contemporary situation here in England. The casualness, the sense that it can function at a low pressure, that one can write occasional poems, that one can be wry, self-deprecating, amusing, perhaps slightly embarrassed; the sense in which a poem can apparently be written at a fairly low level of engagement, of interest, of committal---all this seems very foreign to me, I think.^[Prynne interviewed by Orr, *The Poet Speaks*, Programme 39 (6 January 1964).]

\noindent Prynne's use of the word 'foreign' here is striking, not least because these qualities are seen to represent precisely the English character of contemporary poetry in similar statements from this period, raising the possibility that it is Prynne himself who is in some sense foreign. Reviewing Michael Hamburger and Christopher Middleton's anthology *Modern German Poetry, 1910--1960* (1962), Prynne repeatedly sets up and opposes the categories 'England' and 'Europe', claiming, for example, that '[it] is [...] a fundamental difference between the imaginative climate of England and Europe, both in tone and in structure, that this anthology is valuable for setting before us', and referring to 'the gap between the intellectual climates responsible for Larkin or Hughes on one side, and Ingeborg Bachmann or Paul Celan on the other.'^[Prynne, '"Modernism" in German Poetry', *The Cambridge Review* (9 March 1963), 331--33, 335, 337 (p. 337).]  In a roughly contemporaneous letter to the little magazine *Mica*, he describes 'English writers of verse [as] sheltering with provincial timidity behind the irony inherited from Eliot', while in a 1961 letter to Olson he deplores the insularity of 'Betjeman's England (the logical successor to Auden's)'.^[Prynne, 'from a letter', p. 3; Prynne to Olson, 4 November 1961. The implicit denunciation of Auden here bears comparison with F.R. Leavis's attitude to the 'MacSpaunday' group, a conjunction which will be explored in the following section of this chapter.]  This last statement offers a solution to the problem, suggesting that while Prynne considers 'wry, self-deprecating, amusing' tendencies to be typically English at that point in time, this is a development that is both regrettable and historically contingent. Englishness has been hijacked by Betjeman; it is not a quality to which he can claim an absolute right.

The three events considered above show Davie introducing Prynne to the mechanisms of mainstream poetic publicity and Prynne shifting between acquiescence and resistance. As early as September 1962, he had effectively disowned the collection that was to be published with Davie's help, writing to Olson that 'my own Vol. of poems (out November) is 96% of no interest to me. Zip-fastener type of thing---dead as no door-nail would be, given any decent chance.'^[Prynne to Olson, 9 September 1962.]  It is instructive to compare this with Tomlinson's early poetic career: after the publication of a pamphlet of juvenilia, *Relations and Contraries* (1951), with Erica Marx's Hand and Flower Press, it was Davie's support of Tomlinson's 'first real collection', *The Necklace* (1955), which helped him 'find [his] way into print' in a more permanent sense, and that set the tone for his subsequent work.^[Tomlinson, 'The Art of Poetry'. Prynne himself notes, in a letter to Dorn, that 'Davie has encouraged [Tomlinson] right from his smallest beginnings [...] and done his best to get him accepted here [i.e. in England] (in the face of concerted indifference from almost all sides)' (Prynne to Dorn, 9 July 1962).]  Prynne and Tomlinson both clearly felt ambivalent about using the cultural capital accumulated through Davie's association with the Movement in order to further their own very different poetics. From the late 1960s onwards, Prynne's aversion manifested itself in an almost total rejection of the mainstream literary world, the details of which will be discussed in the first part of Chapter 2; Tomlinson, by contrast, had enjoyed the fruits of Davie's influence much earlier, and was thus able, once established, to distance himself less completely from the older poet. Prynne's early involvement with Davie nevertheless complicates any attempt to present his work as some sort of *sui generis* avant-garde artefact, or even to characterise it primarily as an English offshoot of the Olsonian poetic project.

Discussing a series of parodies of Movement poets written by Amis and Larkin in 1956, Zachary Leader makes a helpful point about the fluidity of literary allegiances in the 1950s, which might apply just as well to the 1960s. While Stephen Spender was by this point one of the Movement's chief hate figures, Amis was perfectly happy to send him the parodies for publication, with he and Larkin thereby 'including their detractors in a trick they hoped to play on their supporters.'^[Zachary Leader, 'Introduction: Origins and Ambivalences', in *The Movement Reconsidered: Essays on Larkin, Amis, Gunn, Davie and Their Contemporaries* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 1--15 (p. 8).]  Just as Amis and Larkin were forced to rely on the existing literary infrastructure represented by Spender's CIA-backed *Encounter* in order to get their voices heard and their names mentioned, Tomlinson and Prynne had little choice but to accept Davie's help if they were to promote their work in any conventional sense: to 'pour' their work into a conventional 'literary and economic mould', as David Trotter writes of *Force of Circumstance*.^[David Trotter, *The Making of the Reader: Language and Subjectivity in Modern American, English and Irish Poetry* (London: Macmillan, 1984), p. 221.]  That Prynne decided, from the late 1960s, to forego this promotion and to seek out alternative models of poetic dissemination is part of what makes his subsequent career so exceptional and worthy of study.^[In this respect, Prynne followed Leavis's strictures against the 'literary racket' much more closely than any of the poets of the Movement, who nevertheless looked to 'the great doctor' as a key influence (Blake Morrison, *The Movement: English Poetry and Fiction of the 1950s* [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980], pp. 63--64).]  As was demonstrated at the beginning of this chapter, conventional encyclopaedic and scholarly conceptions of Prynne's work attempt---consciously or otherwise---to minimise the importance of Davie, framing him as an influence who was quickly superseded following the publication of *Force of Circumstance*. While this is no doubt true in a poetic sense, Davie's practical efforts to aid Prynne in the early 1960s reverberate throughout the younger poet's entire career. Prynne's decision to turn away from commercial publication and the mainstream press was described above as a 'total rejection', and it is true that his attempts to use Davie's literary connections to secure British publication for Olson and Dorn were largely unsuccessful. Yet it was also Davie's influence which helped to secure Prynne's fellowship at Caius, a position which has not only afforded him the time and resources to produce poetic and critical work but has also served as a base, over more than 50 years, for the instruction and encouragement of younger poets. Prynne's attitude to his position at Cambridge will be considered in more detail at the end of this chapter. First, it will be necessary to make another, more contentious, case for influence.


## iii. F.R. Leavis

Speaking at a colloquium on the history of Cambridge English in 2011, Prynne recalled some of the well-known figures with whom he had become acquainted in what was then more than five decades of almost continuous association with the Faculty: 'I knew William Empson only slightly but I enjoyed a free and easy relationship with Ivor Richards over many years, and we had many conversations. I was even quite well acquainted with F.R. Leavis and his wife Queenie.'^[Prynne and Sutherland, 'Introduction to Prynne's Poems in Chinese', *Cambridge Quarterly*, 41.1 (2012), 197--207 (p. 199). The Cambridge English Faculty was formally founded in 1919 and English was given its own independent, two-part Tripos in 1926. Whatever the measure, Prynne has been involved with the Faculty for well over three fifths of its short but eventful life.]  Prynne and F.R. Leavis are very rarely mentioned in the same breath---yet when the apparently obvious political and aesthetic differences between the two men are set aside, there is much to recommend the comparison. Both came up to Cambridge from minor public schools after periods of military service; Prynne was elected fellow of Caius relatively soon after his undergraduate degree while Leavis worked on a Ph.D., but both served as teachers at the university for many decades; both maintained ambivalent relationships with Cambridge as an institution, by turns benefiting from the privileges of relatively secure academic positions and acting as 'ghosts in the machine', opposed to aspects of prevailing academic orthodoxy; most importantly, both Leavis and Prynne have, to an extraordinary degree, inspired successive generations of critical and poetic 'followers', for want of a better term.^[Prynne did in fact begin a doctoral thesis on the work of Thomas Hardy, but only completed one year of research before his election (Johansson, p. 67, n. 66).]  Responding to a piece by Robert Archambeau in 2010, Andrea Brady vigorously contests his use of the label 'Cambridge School', particularly in relation to her own work: 'Personally, I feel like I'm forever being tagged "Cambridge School", even though I've lived in London for twice as long as I was a gownie, and my time in the UK still adds up to far less than half my life.'^[Andrea Brady, letter, *Cambridge Literary Review*, 1.2 (Lent 2010), 244--49 (p. 244).]  Just as with the controversial designator 'the Movement', her rejection of the term is typical of the reactions of poets whom it attempts to subsume. Yet by the mid 2010s a version of this usage had reached the status of an established critical term, meriting inclusion in a 2013 revised edition of the *Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry*:

> \singlespacing the term 'Cambridge School' refers to a particular grouping who began writing in the later 1960s, some of whom studied or worked in the city. J. H. Prynne is a central figure, together with Andrew Crozier, John James, Wendy Mulford, Douglas Oliver, and Peter Riley. [...] As with the New York School, it is now possible to speak of a 'second generation' of Cambridge poets [...]. A major anthology, *Conductors of Chaos* (Picador, 1996), ed. Iain Sinclair, includes work by Andrew Duncan, Michael Haslam, Tony Lopez, Grace Lake, Rod Mengham, Drew Milne, Ian Patterson, Denise Riley and John Wilkinson.^[Nigel Wheale, 'Cambridge School, The', in *The Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry*, 2nd edn, \<http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199640256.001.0001/acref-9780199640256-e-1383\> [accessed 15 December 2014].]

\noindent After moving into university teaching positions, many of these poets have been involved, consciously or otherwise, in the creation of a nascent academic infrastructure---critical books, conferences, Ph.D. supervision---not totally dissimilar to that which grew up around the so-called 'Leavisites', though smaller and largely situated at the tertiary rather than the secondary level of the British education system. To take one of the more obvious examples, as of the 2013/14 academic year the Cambridge English Faculty employed Ian Patterson, Rod Mengham, Simon Jarvis and Drew Milne. All four were taught by Prynne---if not through direct supervision, then through lectures---as undergraduates at Cambridge in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. All four are poets whose work has been published by the same small presses as Prynne's (principally Equipage and Barque, the former being run by Mengham himself). Most importantly, since completing doctoral degrees at Cambridge, all four have supervised further undergraduate, masters or doctoral work on Prynne or related subjects.

While it is likely that Leavis only met Prynne at some point in the late 1960s, once his most important work, represented by the journal *Scrutiny*, was safely behind him, Prynne is likely to have known of Leavis at least a decade and perhaps even twenty years earlier, as a schoolboy at St Dunstan's College in Catford, South East London. As Christopher Hilliard's detailed analysis of admissions records shows, St Dunstan's was one of the most important 'feeder schools' for Leavis's infamous English course at Downing College, sending six boys in total, three in the year 1948 alone.^[Christopher Hilliard, *English as a Vocation: The 'Scrutiny' Movement* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 263--69. While there were no Downing English matriculants from St Dunstan's in Prynne's year, one boy from the year below was successful.]  A memoir written by one of the three records how an older brother advised the school's English master, Basil Harvey---dedicatee of *Force of Circumstance*---on which books would best prepare pupils for Leavis's notoriously exacting scholarship exams.^[David Matthews, *Memories of F.R. Leavis* (Bishopstone: Edgeways Books, 2010), p. 4.]  If Leavis was a distinct presence in Prynne's schooling, what of his undergraduate course? Prynne's friendship with coursemate Roger Langley and their request for supervision by Davie, who had himself been taught by Leavis in the late 1940s, has been described above. It is less clear who else supervised Prynne during this period. As mentioned above, Prynne's college tutor at the time was Laurence Picken, and while this is usually a pastoral role Prynne has made clear that Picken 'taught me my first beginnings of Chinese and encouraged me to help him with translations of some poetic texts.'^[Prynne and Sutherland, p. 201.]  In terms of formal academic supervision, however, there are a number of more obvious candidates. The Shakespeare scholar Philip Brockbank served as a college lecturer at Jesus from 1954 to 1958, before moving to the universities of Reading and York.^['Papers Relating to "Players of Shakespeare"', *Archives Hub*, \<http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb2188-dsh04\> [accessed 16 November 2014]. Prynne's contemporary at Jesus, the medievalist A.C. Spearing, pays tribute to Brockbank's teaching in the paperback edition of his *Readings in Medieval Poetry* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. ix.]  Brockbank was closely associated with Leavis during his tenure at the latter institution, though it is not clear how well the two men knew each other in the late 1950s. The Scottish literary historian David Daiches was, meanwhile, appointed fellow of Jesus in 1957, presumably to fill the teaching gap left by the death of A.P. Rossiter in the same year. Listed as Director of Studies in English in the college's 1959 annual report, Daiches again raises the spectre of Leavis, albeit negatively.^[*Fifty-Fifth Annual Report* (Cambridge: Jesus College Cambridge Society, 1959), p. 44.]  Janet Burroway, a contemporary of Prynne's and a Marshall Scholar at Newnham College during this period, recalls 'a rivalry between the camps of Daiches and Leavis', though Daiches maintained that he only 'learned later' of the war that was 'going on at Cambridge between F.R. Leavis and his enemies'.^[Janet Burroway, 'Was Too: Time Passed with David Daiches', in *David Daiches: A Celebration of His Life and Work*, ed. by William Baker and Michael Lister (Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2008), 28--35 (p. 29); David Daiches, *A Third World* (Brighton: Sussex University Press, 1971), p. 39. A double-edged summary of Leavis's position in Daiches's *The Present Age* (London: The Cresset Press, 1958), pp. 135--41, in which the prophet of Downing is described by turns as 'brilliant', 'shrill' and 'tedious', supports the idea of a certain antipathy between the two men.]  In a recent interview, Prynne also describes being taught by Raymond Williams, who was more than happy to acknowledge his 'Debt to Dr. Leavis' in this period.^[Prynne, 'The Art of Poetry', p. 186; Raymond Williams, 'Our Debt to Dr. Leavis', *Critical Quarterly*, 1.3 (September 1959), pp. 245--56.]

On the basis of this brief biographical sketch, it seems fair to say that Prynne spent his sixth-form and college years in an environment suffused by Leavis's judgements and approach, if only as foils for more catholic approaches to the canon, as in the first volume of Daiches's *Critical History of English Literature* (1960). The results of this distinctive form of critical training can be felt in the early prose piece 'The Elegiac World in Victorian Poetry'. Here, Prynne advances a theory about Victorian 'meditative' poetry which bears a strong resemblance to the argument put forward in Leavis's *New Bearings in English Poetry* (1932). Prynne posits a shift in English poetry following Romanticism, from traditional 'odes and poems of elegiac reflection', which pay at least some attention to the outside world, to a more specific, 'narcotic' form of self-sufficient meditation. In Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey', a poem which precedes the shift proper, 'the conventionalized landscape is already yielding final pre-eminence to the speculation it prompts', but its details still 'stand as legitimate experiential antecedents, as the roots, however apparently slight, from which the subsequent reflection springs.^[Prynne, 'The Elegiac World in Victorian Poetry', *The Listener* (14 February 1963), 290--91 (p. 290).]  By contrast, in Tennyson's 'Ulysses'---'one of the earliest meditative poems in which the change I have been discussing has already taken place'---'[i]ncantation has taken the place of description as the main meditative technique. The world is as wide as the range of one's desires and virtuosity of expression makes it to be, since the poem is not a means of focussing one's attention but of diffusing it.'^[*Ibid*., pp. 290--91.]  Prynne gives the principal characteristic of meditative poetry as 'scene-painting', turning to a contemporary review of Tennyson by John Stuart Mill for a definition:

> \singlespacing Of all the capacities of a poet, that which seems to have arisen earliest in Mr Tennyson, and in which he most excels, is that of scene-painting, in the highest sense of the term: not the mere power of producing that rather vapid species of composition usually termed descriptive poetry---for there is not in these volumes one passage of pure description but the power of *creating* scenery, in keeping with some state of human feeling; so fitted to it as to be the embodied symbol of it, and to summon up the state of feeling itself, with a force not to be surpassed by anything but reality.^[John Stuart Mill, quoted in *ibid*., p. 291; Mill, 'Tennyson's Poems', in *The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume 1 -- Autobiography and Literary Essays*, ed. by John M. Robson (London: Routledge, 2013), 395--418 (p. 399).]

\noindent The part of *New Bearings* from which Prynne's argument can be seen most clearly to derive---or at least to draw inspiration---is the first chapter. Like Prynne, Leavis locates the fulcrum of his argument at the point of transition from the Romantic to the Victorian, arguing that English poets of the later nineteenth century failed to develop aesthetic techniques adequate to changes in the broader intellectual climate and its language, clinging to outmoded 'ideas of the essentially poetical which, when the conditions which gave rise to them [...] changed, bar[red] the poet from his most valuable material'.^[F.R. Leavis, *New Bearings in English Poetry: A Study of the Contemporary Situation* (London: Chatto & Windus, 1932), p. 12.]  At first glance, this emphasis on stasis might seem at odds with Prynne's theory of an important change between, say, Wordsworth and Tennyson, but these attitudes are really two sides of the same coin. The change that Prynne identifies is a reconfiguration of the relationship between poetic language and reality, not necessarily a change in poetic language itself: like passengers in a stationary train carriage, Victorian poets think they are moving forwards when in fact they are simply watching an adjacent train pull out of the station. Differentiating the meditative poetry with which he is concerned from an earlier tradition, Prynne notes that 'performances such as "Lycidas" were essentially public events, monuments crafted out of a shared language, in such a way that the feeling expressed was cogently personal but also anonymous'---the problem for later poets is that the poetic language which they continue to use is no longer 'shared' in any real sense.^[Prynne, 'The Elegiac World', p. 290. Similar points are often made by Leavis, e.g. the following passage from a discussion of *Scrutiny*'s attitude to Marxism: 'A culture expressing itself in a tradition of literature and art [...] can be in a healthy state only if this tradition is in living relation with a real culture, shared by the people at large. The point might be enforced by saying (there is no need to elaborate) that Shakespeare did not invent the language he used' (Leavis, 'Under Which King, Bezonian?', in *A Selection from 'Scrutiny'*, vol. 1, ed. by Leavis [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968], 166--74 [p. 169]). The parenthetical 'there is no need to elaborate' is a characteristic Leavisian move. Prynne's choice of 'Lycidas' as an example may have been inspired by John Crowe Ransom's 'A Poem Nearly Anonymous' (*The American Review* [May 1933], pp. 179--203), an essay of which he spoke approvingly in 2014 (Prynne, 'A Dialogue with Nicholas Royle').]  Importantly, Prynne and Leavis not only provide common diagnoses of the disjunction between poetic language and the world in which it is written, but also provide remarkably similar assessments of the texture of this language---what it feels like to read. 'Nineteenth-century poetry,' writes Leavis, '[...] was characteristically preoccupied with the creation of a dream-world.'^[Leavis, *New Bearings*, p. 10. The astonishing audacity of this claim is, again, characteristic of Leavis's critical work.]  Where Prynne describes meditative poetry as 'narcotic', Leavis notes that, in a piece of 'late Victorian poetastry' by Andrew Lang, 'it is the music of the languid hours that predominates'.^[*Ibid*., p. 12.]  Leavis even identifies Tennyson as a key example of the tendency: 'He might wrestle solemnly with the "problems of the age," but the habits, conventions and techniques that he found congenial are not those of a poet who could have exposed himself to the rigours of the contemporary climate.'^[*Ibid*., p. 15.]

Where 'The Elegiac World' diverges significantly from Leavis is in its assessment of aesthetic developments subsequent to the nineteenth century. As the title suggests, the purpose of *New Bearings* is to set out what makes the work of its three primary subjects---T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Gerard Manley Hopkins---different from the poems that Leavis castigates in the initial chapter. By contrast, Prynne's model of the relationship between late-Victorian and twentieth-century English poetry is fundamentally one of continuity. Introducing his argument via Wallace Stevens's late poem 'The World as Meditation', Prynne brings together 'Tennyson's "In Memoriam", Arnold's "Dover Beach" [and] Eliot's "Prufrock"' as three more poems which give 'a rough idea of what I mean' by the word meditative.^[Prynne, 'The Elegiac World', p. 290.]  Eliot is considered in more detail at the very end of the piece, where he is ambivalently credited with having 'maintained the subjective cocoon while draining it of its overt melancholy. We remain inside the mind, but it is not clear whose mind is in question, and the emotional modality is largely neutralized.'^[*Ibid*., p. 291. Prynne's position *vis-à-vis* Eliot is made much clearer in the 1962 letter to the little magazine *Mica* cited earlier, in which Eliot's 'fundamental error' is given as his tendency to make the poem's 'object [...] the poet's anterior experience' rather than 'the poem's achieved shape' (Prynne, 'from a letter', p. 28).]  There is a parallel here with Leavis's assessment of Eliot's 'Gerontion' in the third chapter of *New Bearings*, where he praises the poem's 'really dramatic detachment': 'From a position far above his immediate concerns as a particular individual, projecting himself, as it were, into a comprehensive and representative human consciousness, the poet contemplates human life and asks what it all comes to.'^[Leavis, *New Bearings*, p. 83.]  Yet where Leavis sees a decisive break, Prynne sees a development in a tradition, as his final paragraph makes clear:

> \singlespacing The Victorian meditative poem was too crass in its sentimentalism, by and large, to remain adequate as an acknowledged model for twentieth-century technique; but in the structure of its world and its means of creating around it its own ambience---'scene-painting', in Mill's phrase---it remains unexpectedly with us. Like Penelope in Stevens's poem, the modern poet would hardly recognize a contingent event if he saw one, and least of all if he had been expecting it.^[Prynne, 'The Elegiac World', p. 291. The sense of Eliot as continuing a tradition is reiterated in negative terms in the review of the German poetry anthology, in which Prynne claims that 'only Pound can be said to have resisted all the attractions of reversion to some aspect of th[e] Pre-Raphaelite or Tennysonian ethos' (Prynne, '"Modernism" in German Poetry', p. 332).]

\noindent That Prynne considers himself at least partially exempt from this last comment is suggested by the language used to set out the argument in the earlier stages of the piece: writing approvingly of 'Tintern Abbey', he notes that 'in Wordsworth's encounter with his theme there remains a positive force of circumstance', the latter three words being the title of Prynne's own first collection of poems.^[*Ibid*., p. 290.]

It is worth dwelling on what Prynne might actually mean by this phrase, and by his apparent enthusiasm for the 'contingent event' in the passage quoted above. On one level, 'force of circumstance' is a conventional phrase, usually preceded by 'through' or 'by' and used to indicate unavoidable, external pressures impinging on the subject of a sentence. The *Times Digital Archive* shows its first usage in the newspaper in 1833, with much more regular appearances from the end of the Edwardian period. As a title, 'The Force of Circumstance' had already been used by W. Somerset Maugham in 1928, while Steve Clark notes that Prynne's usage 'perhaps alludes to Hardy's *Satires of Circumstance*'.^[Clark, 'Prynne and the Movement'.]  In the context of this particular collection of poems, however, there seems to be a more pressing ideological-aesthetic meaning. James Keery has claimed provocatively that 'on the strength of this early collection alone Prynne deserves to be recognised as the finest Movement poet bar Larkin and Davie.'^[James Keery, 'The Great Tradition', *PN Review*, 23.6 (1997), \<http://www.pnreview.co.uk\slash cgi-bin\slash scribe?item\_id=35\> [accessed 28 November 2014].]  Whether or not this act of recuperation can be accepted in its entirety, Keery's earlier contention that '*Force of Circumstance* is recognisably derivative from Davie' is not substantially in doubt.^[*Ibid*.]  Given this, it seems appropriate to read the valorisation of 'force of circumstance' as an anti-Romantic, Movement-style exhortation to modesty: an injunction not to interfere unduly with the forces that shape circumstance, but simply to observe and to record them.^[According to Davie in his admittedly partisan account, 'Prynne's emphasis is frequently on patience, on lowering the sights, settling for limited objectives' (Davie, *Thomas Hardy and British Poetry*, p. 113).]  This certainly seems to be force of the phrase in the collection's titular poem, in which the speaker reflexively contemplates his or her own memory of a 'broken, idle mill-wheel', repeatedly refusing to modify the image by making the wheel turn, or even by imagining the reconstruction of 'the rotting chute | That brought the water to it' in order to allow it to turn of its own accord.^[Prynne, 'Force of Circumstance', in *Force of Circumstance and Other Poems* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1962), p. 1.]  For the speaker, 'the force | Of circumstance [...] protects the place', preventing any such interference, though at the poem's conclusion he or she is permitted to 'set a heron down, a tense | And watchful silence' which figures the speaker's own position as observer.^[*Ibid*. This reticent relation between subject and object is similar to what Davie sees in Pound as the rejection of 'an imperious, appropriating attitude towards the perceived world' (Davie, *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*, p. 173).]

The phrase 'contingent event', as used by Prynne, has the potential to confuse this interpretation. The clearest source for this concept is Chapter 9 of Aristotle's *De Interpretatione*, which raises the famous question of the truth value of the proposition 'A sea battle will take place.' If any proposition must be either true or false, then whether or not the battle will take place must already have been determined, a situation which apparently leaves no room for contingency. Citing the common-sense perception of human will as causative, Aristotle attempts to reconcile these conflicting positions by seeming to restrict the principle of bivalence: 'Everything must either be or not be, whether in the present or in the future, but it is not always possible to distinguish and state determinately which of these alternatives must necessarily come about.'^[Aristotle, *On Interpretation*, trans. by E.M. Edghill, in *The Works of Aristotle*, vol. 1, ed. by W.D. Ross (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1928), 19a25.]  This ambiguous solution to what has been termed the problem of future contingents provided the fuel for a long-running debate over the relationship between human free will and God's omnipotence, particularly in the Scholastic period. Much of this discussion was spurred by an influential commentary on Aristotle's text by the late Roman philosopher Boethius, an author to whom Prynne has acknowledged a profound debt.^[Introducing 'The Corn Burned by Sirius' during a 1971 reading in Vancouver, Prynne explained that the poem 'is borrowed in every sense but the literal from a book which I have really had in my mind for years now, the *Consolation of Philosophy* by Boethius' (Prynne, reading [York Street Commune, Vancouver, 1 August 1971], *Archive of the Now* \<http://www.archiveofthenow.org/authors/?i=77&f=1762\#1762\> [accessed 17 December 2014]).]  What, then, does Prynne mean when he claims that 'the modern poet would hardly recognize a contingent event if he saw one, and least of all if he had been expecting it'? The traditional opposition between contingency and necessity would seem to undercut his point---surely it is the *necessary* event which shows the true force of circumstance, determined as it is by external forces rather than by human will? It is possible, however, to suggest that in the context of 'The Elegiac World' a necessary event would be one which fit too neatly into the poem's meditative structure, as conceived by the poet himself (pronoun Prynne's). A contingent event is in this sense the type of event most truly determined by circumstance. The final part of Prynne's comment---'and least of all if he had been expecting it'---would seem on this reading to be a joke at the expense of poets who are eager to bear witness to contingent reality, but only within their own pre-conceived formal structures.

Beyond literary criticism, a number of Prynne's early letters to Olson and Dorn also bear Leavis's mark in their scathing assessments of the English literary and artistic scene. In his very first letter to Olson, for instance, Prynne takes aim at one of Leavis's favourite targets, the so-called Bloomsbury Set, supposedly 'still in the saddle' in 1961; his next letter includes a brief shot at Auden, another Leavisian bugbear.^[For Clive Bell, a key participant, Bloomsbury was firmly in the past tense as early as 1954 (Clive Bell, 'What was "Bloomsbury"?', *Twentieth Century* [February 1954], pp. 153--60); Prynne to Olson, 4 November 1961; Prynne to Olson, 26 November 1961.]  Bloomsbury is again attacked in a 1962 letter to Dorn, though tempered by a precisely anti-Leavisite impatience with a situation in which 'D.H. Lawrence is a culture-hero and Ezra Pound a sort of curious and sinister joke.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 9 July 1962. That the Bloomsbury Set was self-evidently *not* 'in the saddle' in 1961, many of its key members being long dead, supports the idea that this was a judgement adopted wholesale from Leavis rather than Prynne's own considered view of the contemporary situation.]  Leavis's opposition to Bloomsbury is part of a broader assault on what he describes, in a discussion of John Maynard Keynes and Stephen Spender, as 'the habit of substituting the social-personal values for the relevant ones'; Prynne, for his part, rails against '*seeing a lot of each other as method*' in a May 1967 letter to Peter Riley, referring to the work of younger poets associated with *The English Intelligencer*.^[Leavis, 'Keynes, Spender and Currency-Values', in *A Selection from 'Scrutiny'*, vol. 1, 185--96 (p. 195); Prynne to Riley, 21 May 1967. This position is also reflective of the more general, anti-personal attitude expressed by Davie in his poem to Tomlinson, 'To a Brother in the Mystery': 'Never care so much | For leaves or people, but you care for stone | A little more' (Davie, *New & Selected Poems* [Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1961], p. 46).]  Both attitudes seem to derive, at least in part, from a suspicion of a particular form of homosocial interaction. Q.D. Leavis, at one with her husband on matters Bloomsbury, extends to outright homophobia in her discussion of the public school *milieu*, attributing the success of the 'evidently unqualified reviewers [who] fill the literary weeklies' to 'hav[ing] been "the most fashionable boy in the school", or to hav[ing] had a feline charm or a sensual mouth and long eyelashes.'^[Q.D. Leavis, 'The Background of Twentieth Century Letters', in *A Selection from 'Scrutiny'*, vol. 1, 162--66 (p. 165).]  Prynne, in a slightly earlier letter to Riley, raises an odd objection to close male-male contact that fails to extend to 'the full homosexual passion & stop at nothing', while a later mention of John Ashbery and his 'various camp followers' encouraging 'feeble insecurity' in young English poets is more overtly homophobic.^[Prynne to Riley, 24 April 1967; Prynne to Riley, 16 March 1969. The surface-level meaning of 'camp' in 'camp followers' is 'encampment', but it would be implausible to claim that the phonologically and semantically attentive Prynne is unaware of its other meanings. In any case, the phrase 'camp followers' itself carries sexual connotations, referring to wives and prostitutes travelling with an army.]

Whether following Leavis's judgements or challenging them, the most significant thing is that Prynne is engaging with them, and doing so in a broadly Leavisite style: briskly and with a minimum of argument. This formal similarity between Prynne and Leavis can be seen even in relation to the latter's most elitist critical positions, including his well-known advocacy of 'minority culture'. Writing in the opening paragraphs of his pamphlet *Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture* (1930), Leavis uses an epigraph from Matthew Arnold and a quotation from I.A. Richards to launch into a typically vague statement of his basic position. 'The minority capable not only of appreciating Dante, Shakespeare, Donne, Baudelaire, Hardy (to take major instances) but of recognising their latest successors constitute the consciousness of the race (or a branch of it) at a given time', writes Leavis, laying stress on the close relationship between this minority and language: 'In their keeping [...] is the language, the changing idiom, upon which fine living depends, and without which distinction of spirit is thwarted and incoherent. By "culture" I mean the use of such a language.'^[Leavis, *Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture* (Cambridge: The Minority Press, 1930), pp. 14--15.]  On a purely terminological level, it is revealing that Prynne uses the term 'discriminating minority' to describe the audience for Daiches's and Davie's talks to the Jesus College Literary Society in the report referred to above, though this may of course be an ironic usage. Writing to Ed Dorn in 1963, in the wake of a disappointing encounter with a major publishing house, he follows Leavis more explicitly, railing against the commercial debasement of literary standards:

> \singlespacing They [i.e. the publishers] pretend to listen when spoken to (as in the enclosed missive), but are in fact all the time reckoning up what's in it for them and how the Great British Public will take it. And the answer of course in most cases is, that they won't take it at all; they've been cossetted [*sic*] in the second-rate for too long, & most of them have given up reading anything but brisk brash novels about the modern social scene.^[Prynne to Dorn, 23 April 1963.]

\noindent This dismissal draws much of its force from the shared Prynnian--Leavisian opposition to 'the habit of substituting the social-personal values for the relevant ones': modern novels are not only produced *by* a coterie system of prominent authors, publishers and newspaper reviewers, but also *about* this system, or its analogues elsewhere in public life. The 'modern social scene' has become a self-sustaining tumour on the body of the 'Great British Public', and the only solution short of cutting it off is to ignore the infected organism entirely. In a letter to the publishing house André Deutsch the following year, occasioned by the rejection of Dorn's novel *The Rites of Passage*, Prynne reiterates this opinion while providing a bold description of his job as a university teacher:

> \singlespacing We agree, it appears, only on the difficulty of selling [the book] to the great British public, who always have and always will prefer the lending library fodder provided for them in such conspicuous abundance. And in any case I suppose that I don't read a great deal of contemporary fiction, since too much of it is insipid, garrulous, and genteel to vanishing point. However, it's my professional business to know the serious ethical shapeliness of real writing when I see it, to find it there and reclaim it for those who will stop to read.^[Prynne to Diana Athill, 17 November 1964. Later in the letter, Prynne takes a swipe at C.P. Snow, a quintessentially Leavisian move.]

Prynne's description of what characterises 'real writing' as a 'serious ethical shapeliness' is worth considering in detail. What might at first glance seem like a string of weighty adjectives designed to puff up the status of his 'professional business' in fact ties in with previous statements made by Prynne about poetic form. In particular, the word 'shapeliness' echoes a 1962 *paean* to 'the poem's achieved shape': 'This is not only the words as isolated monads, but their ordering; the grammar of feeling: the movement forward speeded or checked by the adverbs, bent, inverted or split by the conjunctions, maintained always by the constant verb.'^[Prynne, 'from a letter', p. 28.]  This, in turn, recalls both the argument put forward in the 1961 piece 'Resistance and Difficulty', which celebrates the ability of poems to become real objects in the world, perceptible through their very resistance to perception, and the editorial statement appended to Prynne's issue of *Prospect*, which declares that '[w]ork sent in should preferably be extensive enough to define its own contour'.^[Prynne, 'Resistance and Difficulty', *Prospect*, 5 (Winter 1961), pp. 26--30; editorial note, *Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), [p. 45]. For discussion of both *Prospect* and 'Resistance and Difficulty', see Chapter 2.]  The most important five words of the quotation above can, however, be found in the first sentence: 'always have and always will'. While a disgruntled letter to a publisher should not be taken too seriously as a statement of fundamental artistic principles, Prynne's position here is remarkable both for its elitism and for its pessimism: he seems at least to acknowledge a structural component ('conspicuous abundance') in the determination of the reading habits of the 'great British public', but also seems to rule out any possibility of change---those who 'will stop to read' will stop anyway, regardless of Prynne's professional efforts; those who won't, won't. There is, of course, more than one model for aesthetic elitism in the long history of modernism---Leavis himself was strongly influenced by Eliot's critical work---but, given the prominence of Leavis both in Prynne's 'schooling so-called' and in the Cambridge environment of the late 1950s and early '60s, it would be misleading not to note similarities where they arise.^[Prynne to Olson, 8 January 1962.]

Does this formative exposure to Leavis leave any trace in Prynne's mature work, specifically that which was produced subsequent to his now-disowned debut collection? To attempt to answer this question, a specific set of ideas which appear in Prynne's poetry and prose in the mid-to-late 1960s will be examined, with the suggestion of either a direct derivation from the pages of *Scrutiny* or a provenance in later intellectual currents nevertheless influenced by Leavis and his supporters. Evidence will then be introduced for a development in Prynne's poetic thinking in the 1970s away from what might be termed the 'vulgar Leavisism' of the essay on Victorian poetry discussed above, before this chapter turns to consider Prynne's and Leavis's respective attitudes towards their professional positions at Cambridge.


## iv. May Day and Metaphor

One of the concerns that has been most clearly identified in Prynne's earliest mature collection, *Kitchen Poems*---and specifically in the long poem 'Die a Millionaire'---is that of 'wants' and 'needs', and the relationship between the two. According to the remarkably straightforward assertions of this poem, imperialism can be described as the idea that 'what you want, you by | historic process or just readiness | to travel, also "need"'; furthermore, 'the market defines wants from | single reckoning into a social need', and the engine of modern consumer capitalism itself is the 'mass-conversion of *want* (sectional) into | *need* (social & then total)'.^[Prynne, 'Die A Millionaire', in *Poems*, pp. 13--16.] Referring to a number of other poems, as well as to the short prose piece 'About Warning an Invited Audience', Sutherland notes that Prynne's attitude here 'bears a strong affinity to Guy Debord's Situationist polemic against "alienated consumption" in *The Society of the Spectacle*, published, like Prynne's "Warning", in 1967.'^[Sutherland, 'J.H. Prynne and Philology', pp. 169--70.]  The comparison is apt, and there is indeed evidence that Prynne was reading Situationist material in this period. Writing to Peter Riley in September 1967, he describes how Barry MacSweeney is 'translating Le Point d'Explosion de l'Idéologie en Chine, a current pamphlet from l'Internationale Situationniste'---this pamphlet, like many of the anonymous texts printed in *IS*, was authored by Debord.^[Prynne to Riley, 13 September 1967.]  Nevertheless, it would be extremely optimistic to think that the intellectual background to a collection as complex as *Kitchen Poems* could be mapped cleanly on to a single source, particularly as there is at least one other strong contender for influence.

Exactly three months before the letter referred to above, Prynne sent Riley a postcard and a copy of the *May Day Manifesto*, which had been published the previous month.^[Prynne to Riley, 13 June 1967.]  Edited by Stuart Hall, E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams, the manifesto 'appeared with the names of over 70 signatories---writers, academics and activists associated with the New Left.'^[Michael Rustin, 'Revisiting the *May Day Manifesto* of 1967--68', in *May Day Manifesto 1967--68*, ed. by Raymond Williams (London: Lawrence & Wishart, 2013), vi--xxi (p. vi). In his *Paris Review* interview, Prynne describes how he 'objected to Raymond Williams's ideologies when he was my teacher [at Jesus College]', but 'became much more committed ideologically to what would be regarded as a left-wing [...] point of view' during the escalation of the Vietnam War in the mid-to-late 1960s, partly as a result of conversations with Ed Dorn. He goes on to describe his present political position as that of 'a peculiar and extraneous Marxist, in some sense of that word' (Prynne, 'The Art of Poetry', p. 186).]  Prynne clearly considered it important enough for Riley to have his own copy, instructing him not to return it 'as I'll get another here'. The *May Day Manifesto* is concerned with the political economy of then-contemporary Britain, focusing particularly on the country's position as a client state in a global economy dominated by the United States, its relationship with its former colonies through the dubious frameworks of 'international development', and the various facts on the ground, especially the structural dominance of the Labour Party, which had served as blocks to the emergence of any radical left-wing challenge to the *status quo*. Throughout this broadly Western Marxist analysis, the manifesto maintains a crucial focus on the fundamentally constructed nature of what economists term 'demand', a focus which is at its sharpest in Chapter 13, on 'The laws of the new market': 'The process of diffusion of new wants is conditioned and reinforced by advertising in which ideas of prestige and status are directly exploited. When breakfast cereals packets ask, in colour, whether we "want to be the first family in our road to have colour T.V.", a new "want" is being created in thousands of homes.'^[*May Day Manifesto*, p. 47.]  The scope of concern here is perhaps more locally economic than Prynne's---nevertheless, the similarities in terminology, particularly the use of the substantive form of the verb 'want', are striking. There is less direct comparison between 'wants' and 'needs' in the *May Day Manifesto* than there is in Prynne's work, but here, again, there are linguistic similarities: the phrase 'social need', for example, which appears in Chapter 7 of the manifesto, or the general assertion in Chapter 13 that 'the mass consumption path set by market-led growth *generates needs* for increasingly higher standards of public provision' (emphasis mine).^[*Ibid*., p. 50.]

As mentioned above, the *May Day Manifesto* was a product of the New Left: specifically, the group surrounding the journal *New Left Review*, which was formed by the merger of the *New Reasoner* and the *Universities and Left Review* in 1960. This group, in turn, owed an extraordinary---if contradictory---intellectual debt to Leavis and *Scrutiny*, a debt fully acknowledged in Francis Mulhern's *The Moment of 'Scrutiny'* (1979) and Raymond Williams's contribution to the 1959 *Critical Quarterly* symposium on 'Our Debt to Dr. Leavis'. In terms of concrete ideas, one of the key inheritances was precisely the focus on the manipulation of wants and needs described above. While this was an idea of great importance to Marx, particularly in his early work, its significance in the broad tradition of Marxist scholarship has been limited by accidents of publication. As Andrew Chitty points out, '[i]t was in the *Notes on James Mill* (1844), the *Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts* (1844) and *The German Ideology* (with Engels, 1845--6), that Marx worked out his philosophical anthropology'---yet these texts all remained unpublished well into the twentieth century.^[Andrew Chitty, 'The Early Marx on Needs', *Radical Philosophy*, 64 (Summer 1993), 23--31 (p. 23).]  Crucially, the *Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts* and the *Notes on James Mill*, in which the concept of need is dealt with most directly, were first translated into English as late as 1959 and 1975 respectively, creating a gap in English-language Marxist scholarship not significantly bridged until the translation of Ágnes Heller's *The Theory of Need in Marx* in 1976.^[Karl Marx, *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, trans. by Martin Mulligan (Moscow: Progress, 1959); Marx, 'Comments on James Mill, *Éléments d'économie politique*', trans. by Clemens Dutt, in Marx and Friedrich Engels, *Collected Works, Volume 3: Marx and Engels, 1843--1844* (London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1975), pp. 211--28.]  Herbert Marcuse's *One-Dimensional Man* (1964), with its discussion of 'false needs', would certainly have had an influence on the *May Day Manifesto* group, as would much of the other culturally-focussed work of the Frankfurt School. Three decades earlier, however, *Scrutiny* was also clearly concerned with, for example, the role of advertising in the proliferation of new human needs. Key examples of this attitude are F.R. Leavis and Denys Thompson's *Culture and Environment* (1933), which positions literary-critical training specifically as a tool to resist the call of the ad-men, and Q.D. Leavis's *Fiction and the Reading Public* (1932), which focuses on the marketing of modern fiction. Rather than focus on economics proper, a number of *Scrutiny*'s contributors took a sociological turn, drawing on American works like Robert and Helen Lynd's *Middletown* (1929) in attempts to chart the future of an increasingly consumerist British society.^[Hilliard, pp. 56--58; Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, *Middletown: A Study in American Culture* (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1929).]  Discussing Frank Whitehead's contribution to the 1964 Penguin paperback *Discrimination and Popular Culture*, edited by Thompson, Hilliard describes it as 'a conspectus of *Scrutiny* arguments about advertising from thirty years before', going on to provide a summary which, if rendered into the present tense, would not seem out of place in Chapter 10, on 'Advertising', of the *May Day Manifesto*:

> \singlespacing The standardization of goods effected by mass production meant that advertising was needed to create illusory differences, a distinctive 'emotional aura' for each brand (of cigarettes, for instance). [...] Advertising encouraged people to define the good life in materialistic terms. Advertising pandered to bad desires and manufactured new ones.^[Hilliard, pp. 180--81.]

\noindent That Prynne's work is concerned with the manufacture of such 'bad desires' is clear. If this attitude can be plausibly linked to a French intellectual *milieu* still relatively obscure in the Britain of the mid 1960s (the first English translation of Debord's *Society of the Spectacle* was not produced until 1970), then it can surely also be traced to an indigenous equivalent which, though politically and aesthetically far-removed, nevertheless shared some of its concerns.

A divergence between Prynne and Leavis can, nevertheless, be felt in their one clearly documented encounter, which occurred in the letters pages of the *Times Literary Supplement* in 1971. On 6 May that year, the *TLS* printed the text of a lecture titled 'The Osmotic Sap', delivered by the Movement poet Roy Fuller in his role as Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford. The theme of the lecture was the interaction between poetry and science, one which might be expected to pique the interest both of the recent author of *Brass* (1971) and of Leavis, who had famously engaged with C.P. Snow over a similar issue during the 'Two Cultures debate' less than a decade earlier. Fuller begins the lecture with two extended quotations. The first is taken from Leavis's celebrated 'revaluation' of Shelley, first printed in *Scrutiny* in 1935 and subsequently collected in *Revaluation: Tradition and Development in English Poetry* (1936). Here, Leavis uses the second section of Shelley's 'Ode to the West Wind' to launch a full-scale attack on the poet's approach to metaphor: 'What [...] are those "tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean"? They stand for nothing that Shelley could have pointed to in the scene before him; the "boughs," it is plain, have grown out of the "leaves" in the previous line, and we are not to ask what the tree is.'^[Leavis, 'Revaluations (VIII): Shelley', *Scrutiny*, 4.2 (1935), 158--80 (p. 159).] Making use of a biological metaphor himself, Leavis summarises what he opposes in Shelley as 'a general tendency of the images to forget the status of the metaphor or simile that introduced them and to assume an autonomy and a right to propagate, so that we lose in confused generations and perspectives the perception or thought that was the ostensible *raison d'être* of imagery'.^[*Ibid*., p. 160.]  Having quoted Leavis at length, Fuller proceeds to quote an extended passage from the physicist and poet Desmond King-Hele's *Shelley: His Thought and Work* (1960) in which every detail of the 'Ode to the West Wind' is meticulously accounted for in modern meteorological terms. The central thrust of the argument is that Shelley's 'loose clouds' are of the fractostratus type, and that '[t]he *tangled boughs* from which these leaf-like clouds are shaken are those regions of air whose slightly adverse pressures, temperature and humidities make them the destined birthplace for clouds.' Furthermore, '[t]hese parcels of air, turbulent, ever-changing in shape like wind-blown boughs, contain a mixture of water-vapour from *Ocean* and air from *Heaven*.'^[Desmond King-Hele, quoted in Roy Fuller, 'The Osmotic Sap', *Times Literary Supplement* (6 May 1971), 559--61 (p. 559); King-Hele, *Shelley: His Thought and Work* (London: Macmillan, 1960), p. 216.]

Leavis was predictably unimpressed by the narrow scientism of this supposed refutation and wrote to the editor of the *TLS* on 21 May to defend his 35-year-old argument:

> \singlespacing One needn't question the scientific accuracy of the detailed point with which [King-Hele] defends the stanza, in order to reflect that imagery which has to be explained in this way does not owe the persuasiveness it has had, and can still have, for lovers of Shelley to the kind of felicity the meteorological specialist elucidates here. The reader who finds 'shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean' potent and right (as he may go on doing after accepting Mr. King-Hele's defence) is not enjoying delicately precise and felicitous observation, but paying implicit tribute to the Shelleyan hypnoidal power, which precludes the kind of actively intelligent attention Mr. King-Hele's defence required of him---and required of Mr. Fuller.^[Leavis, letter, *Times Literary Supplement* (21 May 1971), p. 593.]

\noindent Both the argument and the language here bear an even stronger resemblance to Prynne's 'The Elegiac World' than does Chapter 1 of *New Bearings in English Poetry*. The reference to a lack of 'actively intelligent attention', for instance, echoes Prynne's comments on meditative poetry as 'a means not of focussing one's attention but of diffusing it', while a later description of Shelley's 'Adonaïs' as 'a triumph of intoxicated and intoxicating narcissism' could have been lifted directly from Prynne's essay (though given Shelley's dates and Prynne's description of the 1833 'Ulysses' as one of the earliest poems 'in which the change I have been discussing has already taken place', the actual assessment would likely be out of place). By 1971, however, Prynne's view both of Shelley and of the qualities originally identified by Leavis---the 'tendency of the images to forget the status of the metaphor'---is absolutely not in accordance with that of the older critic. Entering the fray on 28 May with another letter to the editor, Prynne does not attempt to counter the descriptive aspect of Leavis's assessment of Shelley. In fact, he agrees with it, describing it as 'a brilliantly shrewd piece of attentiveness to the uncongenial.'^[Prynne, letter, *Times Literary Supplement* (28 May 1971), p. 620.]  What he puts in question is 'whether the second stage of the diagnosis [i.e. that Shelley is a bad poet] necessarily follows from the first [i.e. that Shelley pursues metaphor beyond strictly mimetic bounds]: and if not necessarily, then whether in a range of important particular cases it seems actually to describe our critical response.'^[*Ibid*.]  The tone of the letter ('And I should have thought it possible by now ...') is weary, as if it is frustrating to have to make such a basic logical point 'thirty-five years later', though in actual fact Leavis's original revaluation was published before Prynne was born. As Ross Wilson puts it, Prynne 'responds to Leavis with a stern acuity of which Leavis himself would have been proud', even taking a swipe at Leavis's critical method: 'we can by now surely see why, assuming on prior moral-epistemic grounds a necessary entailment, Dr. Leavis could hardly make a dispassionate critical appraisal of the actualities.'^[Ross Wilson, *Shelley and the Apprehension of Life* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 25.]

What is most interesting about Prynne's letter, however, is not its demolition of the Leavisian position but the aesthetic potential that he goes on to attribute to Shelley's technique. If Leavis is affronted by the tendency of upwardly mobile images to assume 'autonomy and a right to propagate', Prynne positively encourages it:

> \singlespacing the variable transfer of the criteria for imaginative coherence from the grounds of figurative language to the forms of language resulting from overlapping figurational transformation is a major source of excitement and energy in Shelley's writing. [... A]t its best, this produces a power and vigour of creative intelligence in the working out of ideas astonishingly disregarded at the present time.^[Prynne, letter, *TLS* (28 May 1971).]

\noindent Prynne has, by this point, gone far beyond the rigid schematism of the analysis in his early essay on Victorian poetry, and therefore beyond Leavis as well. As the final words here indicate, Prynne is not only criticising Leavis's well-worn argument, but also passing judgement on what was then contemporary scholarship on Shelley: books like Seymour Reiter's *A Study of Shelley's Poetry* (1967), described by Jerome McGann as 'a leisurely and often disingenuous tour of the Shelley corpus, connecting the works along a thin thread of biography.'^[Jerome McGann, review, *Modern Philology*, 66.3 (February 1969), 280--83 (p. 280).]  This focus on biography at the expense of 'ideas' seems to have been a common feature of work on Shelley in the late 1960s, leading P.H. Butter to review Reiter's book and Donald H. Reiman's *Percy Bysshe Shelley* (1969) in almost exactly mirrored terms: 'Readers familiar with Shelley and Shelley criticism will plod rather wearily through most of this book, in which a sensible but unoriginal account of the poet's life is interwoven with explications of all his major and many of his minor poems'; 'In this book [Reiman] interweaves a sound and accurate account of the events of Shelley's life with interpretations of his chief poems and prose essays.'^[P.H. Butter, review, *Modern Language Review*, 64.2 (April 1969), 407--08 (p. 407); Butter, review, *Modern Language Review*, 65.4 (October 1970), 882--83 (p. 882).]  What, then, is Prynne proposing instead? A clue is provided by his actual critical practice---for example, in his commentaries on Shakespeare, Wordsworth and George Herbert, published from 2001 onwards.^[Prynne, *They That Haue Powre to Hurt; A Specimen of a Commentary on Shake-speares Sonnets, 94* (Cambridge: privately printed, 2001); Prynne, *Field Notes: 'The Solitary Reaper' and Others* (Cambridge: privately printed, 2007); Prynne, *George Herbert, 'Love [III]': A Discursive Commentary* (Cambridge: privately printed, 2011).]  All three of these texts are structured as meticulous, line-by-line---often word-by-word---readings of individual poems. Prynne maintains a fine balance in each case between explication of meaning, identification of potential source material and reference to biographical or contextual data. The focus is fundamentally on the poem as a 'machine made out of words', but not in the strictly acontextual manner of I.A. Richards and without Leavis's overarching emphasis on quality and literary 'standards' (though this may simply be because all three commentaries consider poems of which Prynne approves).^[William Carlos Williams, 'Introduction to *The Wedge*', in *Selected Essays* (New York: Random House, 1954), p. 256.]  This helps to explain the interest shown in the *TLS* letter in Shelley's innovative use of metaphor: Prynne is concerned with what Shelley's language actually does, not with what it *should* do.

In order to show that this attitude has persisted more or less intact throughout Prynne's mature career, it is necessary to bring things full circle and to return to the late poetry of Wallace Stevens with which 'The Elegiac World' began. In a recent prose pamphlet, *Concepts and Conception in Poetry* (2014), Prynne offers a close reading of Stevens' 'Prologues to What is Possible', first published in 1952 in the same issue of *The Hudson Review* as 'The World as Meditation'.^[Wallace Stevens, 'Prologues to What is Possible', *The Hudson Review*, 5.3 (Autumn 1952), pp. 330--31; Stevens, 'The World as Meditation', *ibid*., p. 334.]  In the course of his reading, Prynne repeatedly emphasises the autonomy that the poem achieves through eschewing recognisable exterior reference: 'the development of this poem has been set up to seem to give the poem itself its own autonomy, its opportunity to nominate and follow its own logic, or logics, in which the mariner once notionally in charge merges into the compound vehicle of these flights of resemblance and imagery'.^[Prynne, *Concepts and Conception in Poetry* (Cambridge: Critical Documents, 2014), p. 40.]  Having referred directly to 'the English Romantic poets, exemplary to Stevens', Prynne seems to raise exactly the metaphorical process which he earlier attributed to Shelley, 'the outreach of metaphor from the *tenor* (source domain) of a reference-base to the *vehicle* (target domain) of transformed semblance':

> \singlespacing As the voyage [the ostensible subject of the poem] is transported by the fiction of its conception, being poetically conceived, from the near and familiar to a far distant and unknown 'destination' (*3*), the mariner's own destiny becomes near unrecognisable to himself (*21*), he can scarcely traverse these newly indefinite and far-reaching intervals between the tenor of his own being-in-the-world and the vehicles of devised comparison not fully nor any longer within his control.^[*Ibid*., pp. 39--40.]

\noindent 'Prologues to What Is Possible' is certainly a more self-conscious poem than the 'Ode to the West Wind'---Prynne describes it as being able to 'pick up and even toy with its own strands'---but by virtue of his employment of the same technique of self-developing and self-sustaining metaphor, Stevens is fundamentally a similar poet to Shelley.^[*Ibid*., p. 44.]  By the same token, it seems fair to say that the Prynne who writes so approvingly of Stevens in 2014 is more or less the same as the Prynne who rushed to Shelley's defence in 1971.

A final point of simultaneous comparison and difference can be found in Prynne's and Leavis's respective attitudes to their mutual place of work, the University of Cambridge, and to the British higher education system in general. Now considered a key figure in the history of Cambridge English, Leavis spent much of his early career in positions with relatively low professional status, serving as a probationary lecturer and supervising students at a number of different colleges.^[Hilliard, p. 4.]  His biographer, Ian MacKillop, summarises the precarity of Leavis's position: 'Leavis's probationary lectureship ran out in October 1931. Not until 1936 did he gain a lectureship again, and then only a part-time one. He was kept on "part work" until 1947, when he was over fifty years old.'^[Ian MacKillop, *F.R. Leavis: A Life in Criticism* (London: Allen Lane), p. 152.]  Leavis was not made a fellow at Downing until 1936, at the age of 41, five years after starting work at the college.^[*Ibid*., p. 160.]  His most important critical work, meanwhile, was not printed by Cambridge University Press until the 1960s, appearing instead in the pages of *Scrutiny*, through Gordon Fraser's appropriately named Minority Press, or through metropolitan publishers such as Chatto & Windus. Despite this notable lack of formal institutional support for the Leavisian project, Cambridge was nevertheless the community in which that project took shape, and therefore came to mean something particular to its participants: Perry Anderson describes Leavis's ultimate conception of the city and its university as a sort of 'meta-Cambridge'.^[Perry Anderson, 'Components of the National Culture', *New Left Review*, 1.50 (1968), 3--57 (pp. 53--55).]  In *Scrutiny: A Retrospect*---published, ironically, by CUP in 1963---Leavis makes the ambivalence clear:

> \singlespacing Only at Cambridge could the idea of *Scrutiny* have taken shape, become a formidable life and maintained the continuous living force that made it hated and effective. It was (to deepen the emphasis) a product, the triumphant justifying achievement, of the English Tripos. I express, and intend to encourage, no simple parochial enthusiasm or loyalty in dwelling on these truths. I had better, in fact, add at once the further testimony that *Scrutiny* started, established itself and survived in spite of Cambridge.^[Leavis, *Scrutiny: A Retrospect* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1963), p. 1.]

\noindent In many of Prynne's early letters to Olson and Dorn, he expresses extreme anxiety about his developing academic career. This is especially the case in a June 1963 letter to Dorn, in which he reveals that 'this college [i.e. Caius] has just decided to turn me into a Tutor, college lecturer, official fellow, and next year Director of Studies. It's like getting called to the White House, at the tender age of twenty-six; it feels like death.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 16 June 1963.]  Prynne characterises the offer as a result of 'circumstances latch[ing] on to my own petty capacities for routine ambitiousness' and briefly raises the possibility of rejecting it in order to avoid ever having to make 'compromising decisions [...] on behalf of others'; ultimately, however, he is fatalistic in discussing the supposed inevitability of acceptance: 'It would make no sense to walk out, smash back to a more elemental predicament, since this is not in my nature. Or so I tell myself. Merely to have deliberated in these terms would seem to me to have reduced the possibility to a level of contrived irrelevance.'  Importantly, Prynne presents his acceptance of the offer as an all-or-nothing decision: 'I'd not be capable of not doing [*sic*] what is required with less than complete care; I respect the young too much, and know that they need their opportunities placed very accurately before them.'  This attitude reappears clearly in almost every letter in which Prynne mentions his teaching duties: while he is often critical of what the English Tripos requires him to teach and is invariably exhausted by the obligations of supervisions and marking, he is nevertheless fully committed to the intellectual development of his students and obviously sees the university as at least a potential site for real literary education.

A sense of Prynne's broader attitude towards the university as an institution can be gleaned from another set of letters to the *Times Literary Supplement*. In August 1963, Prynne wrote a letter to the editor responding to a leader article that had appeared in the newspaper's 9 August edition. Titled 'The Library's Place', the article concerned the issue of public funding for university libraries, the context being the rise of the new, so-called 'plate glass' universities and the imminent publication of the Robbins Report, which was to give the official seal of approval to this unprecedented expansion of the British higher education system. The author lamented the 'general parsimony of financial support', arguing for a co-operative acquisitions system comparable to the United States' Farmington Plan, which would allow newer and smaller libraries to build up strengths in specialist areas.^['The Library's Place', *Times Literary Supplement* (9 August 1963), p. 609. The leader was occasioned by an open letter to *The Times* from librarians at the universities of Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester (K.W. Humphreys, R.O. MacKenna and M. Tyson, letter, *The Times* [2 August 1963], p. 13), and by a response from the head librarian at the Bodleian, J.N.L. Myres, which was highly critical of the University Grants Committee's recently formed subcommittee on library issues (J.N.L. Myres, letter, *The Times* [6 August 1963], p. 9).]  For the twenty-seven-year-old Prynne, who had recently completed his first academic year as a fellow at Caius, Clark's leader carried a note of bias. 'You suggest that the prospect ahead is "especially ominous for the less ancient, the recently established, the several merely nascent universities and colleges"', writes Prynne; 'and it is just possible that this may be taken to imply that all is (relatively) well in the case of our major and long-established university libraries'.^[Prynne, letter, *Times Literary Supplement* (16 August 1963), p. 629.]  He proceeds to disabuse Clark of this notion, citing two letters from the University Librarian at Cambridge and ending on a note that can leave no doubt about his position:

> \singlespacing Even granted the prevailing parsimony in the allocation of public funds to education as a whole, there seem at least grounds for disquiet over the internal distribution of funds within ancient and modern universities alike. Terms are relative, but the values to which they refer should be stable enough to withstand bureaucratic erosion; and when in the midst of an affluent society the University Librarian of a major and long-established centre of learning is forced to plead 'exiguous funds', it seems likely that the situation is in need of fairly radical review.

\noindent That Prynne refers to distribution of funds 'within' rather than 'between' universities is important to note: this is not a call to take a hammer to the new plate glass, and there is nothing like the absolute contempt that had been expressed towards Robbins in the conclusion of Leavis's 'Two Cultures?' the previous year.^[Leavis, *Two Cultures?: The Significance of C.P. Snow*, ed. by Stefan Collini (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 112. As Collini points out, 'Lord Robbins, symbolically if not practically the chief architect of [university] expansion, figured prominently in Leavis's demonology in the 1960s, especially for the priority he appeared to give (in his famous report on higher education) to meeting "the needs of the economy"' ('Introduction', in Leavis, *Two Cultures?*, 1--42 [p. 38]).]  Nevertheless, there is a characteristic appeal to antiquity and a sense that the country's 'major and long-established centre[s] of learning' embody certain 'values' that are, if not timeless, at least longer-lasting and certainly more important than those of politics and bureaucracy. This view is certainly consonant with Leavis's conception of the university as 'a real and vital centre of consciousness' and his opposition to 'the publicizers, public relations men, heads of houses, academic ward-bosses, hobnobbers with Cabinet ministers, who are planning, they tell us, to remodel the University and start going a new kind of higher education.'^[*Ibid*., p. 111. Leavis's broader views on higher education, set out most clearly in *Education and the University* (1943), had of course been circulating for decades by the time of Prynne's letter.]

Prynne's *oeuvre* contains a number of texts by which the persistence of this attitude may be tested. The most convenient is an intervention in an official debate held at the Cambridge University Senate House between the release of the Browne Review's report, 'Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education', in October 2010 and the publication of the coalition government's White Paper on higher education reform in June 2011.^['Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education' (12 October 2010), \<https://www.gov.uk\slash government\slash uploads\slash system\slash uploads\slash attachment\_data\slash file\slash 31999\slash 10--1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf\> [accessed 3 March 2014]; 'Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System', *Department for Business, Innovation & Skills* (June 2011), \<https://www.gov.uk\slash government\slash uploads\slash system\slash uploads\slash attachment\_data\slash file\slash 31384/11--944-higher-education-students-at-heart-of-system.pdf\> [accessed 3 March 2014].]  To the extent that this period involved intense public discussion about the future of the English university system, it may be taken as comparable to 1963. Prynne decries what he sees as the government's opportunistic use of the 2007--08 financial crisis as a premise for cuts: 'The current financial crisis is in historical terms a local aberration; yet over-eager and reckless exploitation of the justification it apparently offers, to ransack universities and override their delicate autonomies, can surely inflict deep and permanent damage.'^[Prynne, contribution to a discussion in the Senate House, *Cambridge University Reporter*, 141.15 (2011), \<http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2010--11/weekly/6211/section13.shtml\> [accessed 26 February 2014].]  He also appeals repeatedly to the University of Cambridge's leadership role in opposing government policy. There is a strong sense here of the very same small-'c' conservatism that was apparent in 1963. In phrases such as 'delicate autonomies' and 'core values', Prynne slips into the sort of grandiloquent but ultimately empty language that he himself parodied in 1969 with the phrase 'manifest emergence | of valued instinct', affirming an arm's-length principle of university regulation that cannot but implicitly justify the *status quo*: all change is bad change.^[Prynne, 'L'Extase de M. Poher', in *Poems*, pp. 161--62. It is worth pointing out that Prynne's apparent enthusiasm for the traditional university structure has a direct bearing on poetry. Speaking in conversation with Nicholas Royle in 2014, he declared that much of contemporary English literary culture is 'inert', but that 'university communities' and 'student communities' continue to produce valuable work (Prynne, 'A Dialogue with Nicholas Royle').]  If the analysis above is correct, then Prynne's relationship with Cambridge appears to be broadly similar to Leavis's. Leavis began as an outsider trying to get in; he ultimately succeeded, but was never fully co-opted by the institution. Prynne, on the other hand, began as a somewhat reluctant insider. Though he later adopted a more oppositional stance which would see him remain permanently eccentric to the real centres of academic power, he has nevertheless maintained a basically conventional view of the role of the university in society---in other words, as an autonomous intellectual community bound by its own rules and traditions, which is frequently in need of protection from bureaucratic state intervention.^[The seriousness of Prynne's commitment to the principle of academic autonomy is shown by an incident from 2008. Having pleaded guilty to serious child pornography charges, a Caius fellow was being considered for dismissal. According to a report in the student newspaper *Varsity*, Prynne wrote to his colleagues arguing against 'giv[ing] consideration to questions of possible public interest and outside reactions' when making the decision, asserting that '[w]e are a sovereign community of Fellows and we should act in the light of our individual conscience and judgement' (Hugo Gye, 'Hammond to keep job', *Varsity* [6 November 2008], \<http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/1077\> [accessed 15 October 2015]).]  Writing to Dorn in 1972, Prynne declares that Cambridge 'should never have' given him a permanent job as he 'won't ever produce the gavotte required'.^[Prynne to Dorn, 10 January 1972.]  While this is true if the 'gavotte' is taken to refer to the careful dance of professional advancement through publishing, there is no doubt that through teaching, lecturing, librarianship and general 'committee work', Prynne has more than fulfilled the basic obligations of a Cambridge don, and has even gained a certain level of academic influence.

Despite apparent differences, then, Prynne and Leavis share a fundamental ambivalence towards academia in general and Cambridge in particular. Does it therefore follow---or is it at least plausible---that Prynne's teaching, like his early criticism, has been Leavisian in character? Discussing the legacy of Practical Criticism, the method of textual interpretation developed by I.A. Richards and taken up enthusiastically, though with modifications, by Leavis, Sam Solomon refers to a 2004 document produced by Prynne for incoming students at Caius, 'Tips on Practical Criticism, for Students of English'. This text, argues Solomon, articulates 'a tutorial pedagogical authority with a form of preparatory moral training', and is as such 'quite continuous' with the work of Richards and Leavis, but this isn't its only function: 'there is also a movement within this document against the grain of its structural pedagogical purpose, toward a consideration of the literary text and of critical reading as already social processes and spaces and of reading and writing as forms of labor that produce value.'^[Samuel Solomon, 'Reproducing the Line: 1970s Innovative Poetry and Socialist-Feminism in the UK' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Southern California, 2012), pp. 71--72.]  In fact, 'Prynne foregrounds the limitations that attend the Arnold--Richards--Leavis emphasis on the preparatory nature of literary study as moral training for citizenship.'^[*Ibid*., p. 70.]  Solomon's reading is accurate, but it is important to note that the original focus on 'preparatory moral training' is absolutely not confined to this one text. In a postscript added in 2006 to another 2004 piece, 'Tips on Reading', Prynne makes his position on the moral aspect of a literary-critical education absolutely clear:

> \singlespacing I add also this postscript, because your responsibilities to whatever long-term benefits you derive from reading with insight and enhanced understanding some of the world's finest books do not end as you depart from Caius. When you read and sing to your young children at bed-time, and buy them picture-books for their early birthdays, remember how susceptible are those of tender years and how much your example will mean to them. If you read aloud to them with humour and truth, and prefer reading matter (choose it yourself) which is not slick child-fodder even when simple and direct and pitched right for young minds; and do not allow them to be drawn into a fear or scorn of poetry, and take them all to Christmas pantos which offer sparks of witty imagination, and give good book-presents to nieces and family because you shew that you care about them (both the recipients and the books); then part of the longer-term inwardness of your literary education, a far cry from writing essays and splitting critical hairs, approaches thus a fulfilment which will start to transmit deep values across the generations. That's called being human. Then later you can lure them into kids' libraries and bookshops, buy them writing-notebooks in which they can compose stories to read back to you, and songs to sing and little playlets for family festivals, and so make all this a natural part of their young lives; and of yours also.^[Prynne, 'Tips on Reading, for Students of English', *Gonville and Caius College*, \<http://babylon.acad.cai.cam.ac.uk\slash students\slash study\slash english\slash tips\slash reading.pdf\> [accessed 23 September 2014], p. 14. The model of 'being human' evinced here is, of course, fundamentally reproductive and consequently has strongly heteronormative implications. Prynne does nothing to undercut this interpretation.]

\noindent The evident sincerity of this text makes using it to shore up a scholarly point about Prynne's intellectual influences seem churlish. Yet perhaps this feeling is itself symptomatic of a strong moral strain not only in Prynne's work but also in work on Prynne. This strain is certainly not pure Leavis, but it seems clear that it owes at least something to the editor of *Scrutiny*.


## v. Conclusion

This chapter has argued for the recognition of Leavis as an early influence on Prynne, based on the content of prose works such as 'The Elegiac World in Victorian Poetry' and on the style of Prynne's engagement with certain literary and political issues, most obviously in his correspondence. This influence should not be surprising given that Leavis's critical work and opinions enjoyed wide circulation throughout Prynne's school and college years, yet Leavis was selected as an interesting figure for comparison precisely because the connection is so rarely made: aside from Solomon, whose comments are in any case incidental to his overall argument, no critic appears to have investigated the link. This lack of interest is reflective of the overall paucity of scholarship on Prynne's early career, discussed in the Introduction to this thesis. As was noted, this is not a paucity which can be attributed solely to the inattention or perversity of individual critics: Prynne's withdrawal from commercial publishing and his obvious shift in poetic style following *Force of Circumstance* create an unavoidable sense of rupture in his career, and it is not surprising that many scholars have followed the guidance of their subject in steering their attention towards the later work. One of the implicit arguments of this chapter has, however, been that Prynne's very earliest influences are worth studying precisely because they remain relevant throughout his career. How can this claim be reconciled with Prynne's demonstrable abandonment not only of a number of important Leavisian critical positions but also of the literary world represented by Davie?

A clue may be found in two relatively unknown essays by Davie, published in the journal *Twentieth Century* in 1953 and 1954---following the publication of *Purity of Diction* but before J.D. Scott's coinage of 'the Movement'---and not subsequently collected. In the former, 'Academicism and Jonathan Swift', Davie takes a reprint of Ricardo Quintana's *The Mind and Art of Jonathan Swift* (1936) as the occasion for a disquisition on the relationship between scholarship and pedantry, intervening in the criticism--scholarship debate that was then raging between Leavis and F.W. Bateson in the pages of *Scrutiny*.^[Leavis, 'A Review', *Scrutiny*, 4.1 (June 1935), pp. 96--100; F.W. Bateson, 'A Reply', *Scrutiny*, 4.2 (September 1935), pp. 181--85; Leavis, 'A Rejoinder', *ibid*., pp. 185--87; Leavis, 'The Responsible Critic or The Function of Criticism at Any Time', *Scrutiny*, 19.3 (Spring 1953), pp. 162--84; Bateson, 'The Responsible Critic', *Scrutiny*, 19.4 (October 1953), pp. 317--21); Leavis, 'A Rejoinder', *ibid*., pp. 321--28. All of these pieces are printed in *A Selection from 'Scrutiny'*, 2 vols.]  Defending Quintana against the apparently common view that his book is 'earnest, exhaustive, pedestrian, largely irrelevant but, for its minor virtue of accuracy about facts and dates, indispensable', Davie contrasts its in fact quite subtle analysis with the banal pedantry of a more fashionable book by the critic John M. Bullitt, *Jonathan Swift and the Anatomy of Satire* (1953).^[Davie, 'Academicism and Jonathan Swift', *Twentieth Century* (September 1953), 217--24 (p. 217).]  His point, which he makes with reference to Leavis, is that 'donnishness' is a much less stable epithet than is commonly assumed, and that the characteristics which it denotes (principally pedantry) often apply to self-declared works of criticism more than to those of academic scholarship. Davie admits that, to an increasing extent, 'instead of the professional man of letters we have the professional critic, the young don writing in the first place for other dons, and only incidentally for that supremely necessary fiction, the common reader.'^[*Ibid*.]  Yet he presents the work of Leavis and *Scrutiny*, approvingly, as a sort of academic entryism, keeping criticism pure from inside the ivory tower:

> \singlespacing The work of Dr Leavis and his collaborators in *Scrutiny* over the past twenty years is of enormous importance to anyone seriously interested in the future of British and European culture. And in our period, when the treasures of that culture are passing more and more for safe keeping into academic hands, it is one of the most hopeful signs. For it means that the most mordant and salutary criticisms of academicism have come, and are coming, from inside the academic world itself.^[*Ibid*., pp. 222--23.]

\noindent Leavisism as Davie understands it is, moreover, not a matter of strict adherence to a set of critical rules: 'Any method, however shaky its basis in theory, is justified by results. The wrong approach can give the right results. Hence Dr Leavis has no method. It is his self-styled disciples who have constructed a method which they put forward and practise as his.'^[*Ibid*., p. 223.]

In the second essay, titled 'Is There a London Literary Racket?' after the well-known *Scrutiny* editorial 'The Literary Racket', Davie diverges from Leavis. Having restated his point about the shift in literary authority from the 'the professional man of letters' to the young don in the provincial university, Davie nevertheless admits the continued existence of a highly effective and exclusive metropolitan publicity machine which poses a 'terrible threat' to the maintenance of literary standards: 'When the racketeers emerge the machinery is ready for them to use.'^[Davie, 'Is There a London Literary Racket?', *Twentieth Century* (June 1954), 540--46 (p. 543). It is of course ironic that Davie made this statement barely three months before J.D. Scott kicked off the Movement's own spate of poetic racketeering.]  He goes on to argue, in effect, for the gradual upgrading of that machinery into a real literary culture through more robust reviewing rather than for its summary dismantling. This is the point on which Davie breaks with Leavis, characterising the latter's position as one of ridiculous fundamentalism:

> \singlespacing [What] he asks and hopes for [...] is that dons will keep themselves free from contagion, writing only for such exacting organs as *Scrutiny*, and refusing to broadcast or to review for a weekly or a Sunday paper. [... H]is bitterest scorn is reserved for those who, on the Third Programme or in the weeklies, can be shown to voice opinions or to use methods derived from *Scrutiny*.^[*Ibid*., p. 545. Davie concludes his tirade with the qualification that 'perhaps this is unfair', but does not explain in what way.]

\noindent At this stage, then, Davie's position can be summarised as the advocacy of a long march through the cultural institutions, grasping the spirit of *Scrutiny* in a non-dogmatic fashion and using it to bring critical rigour to venues which Leavis himself, at least in the mid 1950s, would not have touched with a barge pole. This attitude can be usefully compared to Prynne's, considered at length above. As has been shown in relation to Shelley, Prynne clearly abandoned certain Leavisian strictures---notably Leavis's opinion of the limited role of metaphor---in his critical writing from the late 1960s onwards. Yet if Davie is right to state that 'Dr Leavis has no method' and that attempts to claim otherwise are the illegitimate protestations of 'self-styled disciples', then this shift need not be characterised as a fundamental break. Rather, Prynne's critical work can be seen to exist on a spectrum of Leavisian influence, much as his attitude to the university shares elements of Leavis's view while also differing in several respects. Crucially, this mode of critical relation to Leavis, for all its apparent incompleteness, is implied by Davie to be *more* Leavisian than slavish adherence. What of the second part of Davie's position, that which relates to cultural institutions? Here, there is no such get-out clause: in contrast to the question of critical methods, this is one which demands a 'yes' or 'no' answer. Can the machinery of publicity be made to serve the cause of real literary standards? Leavis answers with an emphatic 'no', Davie with a tactical 'yes'. Prynne's position is more variable, appearing as a 'yes' during his early years as a published poet and especially in his attempts to promote Olson and Dorn to English readers, but quickly shifting to a strong 'no' which would waver very little over the course of the next four-and-a-half decades.^[This is not to say that this principle *never* wavered; there are outlying examples such as a 1974 review written for *The Spectator* (Prynne, 'Out of the shade', *The Spectator* [19 January 1974], pp. 78--79).]  Prynne is in this respect more properly Leavisian than most of the so-called Leavisites, and certainly more so than any member of the Movement (including Davie), whose supposed affinity with Leavis is really more socio-cultural than intellectual. As Thomas Mallon puts it in a review of Blake Morrison's *The Movement* (1980), 'if the Sitwells, in Cyril Connolly's famous phrase, belong more to the history of publicity than poetry, the Movement members may ultimately belong as much to the sociology of education as to a history of literary values.'^[Thomas Mallon, 'The Underreachers', *Contemporary Literature*, 22.2 (Spring 1981), 243--47 (p. 246).]
