## Notes

1. Prynne and biographical recalcitrance; Falci.
2. What sort of things are worth looking at? Example: professional name.
3. What have we found out via this method? Thesis summary, [good scientist].
4. Close reading as example of combining biographical and textual approaches. 
5. This *looks* a bit like fatherhood. But it's more complex than that...
