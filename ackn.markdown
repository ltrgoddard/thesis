# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my primary and secondary supervisors, Keston Sutherland and Sara Crangle, for the invaluable guidance and unique insight that they have brought to this project, as well as the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the University of Sussex for supporting it financially. I am grateful to the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut, both for the provision of a Strochlitz Travel Grant and for the assistance and hospitality generously offered by archivists Melissa Watterworth Batt and Tanya Rose. I would also like to thank Sue Brown, former archivist at St. Dunstan's College, Catford. Colleagues and friends have been vital to this project: Ian Patterson, Alex Latter, Michael Tencer and Ian Brinton have all assisted in smaller or larger ways and I have benefited greatly from conversations with Ian Heames, Piers Pennington, Luke Roberts and above all Kay Miller. Finally, I am grateful to J.H. Prynne both for his intellectual rigour and for his personal generosity, qualities which runs like twin seams through his life and work.
