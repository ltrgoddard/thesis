# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my supervisor, Keston Sutherland, for the rigorous guidance and unique insight that he has brought to this project, as well as the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the University of Sussex for supporting it financially. I am grateful to the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut, both for the provision of a Strochlitz Travel Grant and for the assistance and hospitality generously offered by archivists Melissa Watterworth Batt and Tanya Rose. I would also like to thank Sue Brown, former archivist at St. Dunstan's College, Catford. Colleagues and friends have been vital to this project: Ian Patterson, Piers Pennington, Ian Heames, Alex Latter, Michael Tencer and Ian Brinton have all assisted in smaller or larger ways. Finally, I am grateful to J.H. Prynne for his intellectual and personal generosity, a quality which runs like a seam through his life and work.
