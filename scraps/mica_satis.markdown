The role of Gael Turnbull's *Migrant* magazine in defining the contours of the British and American post-war poetic avant garde has, in recent decades, been widely acknowledged.^[Much of this acknowledgement has come from work by Price, including his 2007 article 'Migrant the Magnificent', *PN Review*, 33.4 (2007), pp. 29--34, and his curation of the British Library exhibition 'The Possibility of Poetry' the same year. This section, in turn, takes some of its cues from Price's recent 'CAT-scanning the Little Magazine', in *The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary British & Irish Poetry*, ed. by Peter Robinson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 173--90.] A Scottish medical doctor and poet, Turnbull began publishing the magazine as an offshoot of Migrant Books, which had been set up in 1956 to distribute work from small US poetry presses in the UK---notable books included the two early Jargon Society editions of Olson's *Maximus Poems*.^[Charles Olson, *The Maximus Poems / 1--10* (Highlands, NC: Jargon Society, 1953); Olson, *The Maximus Poems / 11--22* (Highlands, NC: Jargon Society, 1956).] As Richard Price points out, '[b]ecause so many of Turnbull's correspondents were poets Migrant Books became an early and key bridge across the Atlantic between British and American avant-garde writers.'^[Price, p. 30.] When Turnbull emigrated to California in 1958, he moved to shore up this link by opening a permanent channel of communication through the magazine. *Migrant* was produced in Turnbull's garage using a Sears Roebuck mimeograph machine, following the lead of publications like *Yugen*. Contributors---listed by surname only---were generally either Americans associated with Black Mountain (Olson, Dorn, Larry Eigner) or British writers with an interest in the new poetic developments coming out of the college and its associated periodicals. In this sense, leaving aside specific pairings such as Ian Hamilton Finlay and Edwin Morgan, the British side of *Migrant* was much more varied than the American, bringing together a miscellaneous range of poets---Charles Tomlinson, Hugh Creighton Hill, Turnbull's schoolfriend Michael Shayer---which was never likely to solidify into a coherent 'school' or 'movement' analogous to Black Mountain. In fact, the UK--US axis which predominates in practically every one of the magazine's eight issues leads to conjunctions which can seem distinctly odd from the perspective of a now-settled 20th-century literary history: a piece on John Osborne's *Look Back in Anger* sandwiched between poems by Corman and Robert Duncan in Issue 2 (September 1959), for example, or an article by Alan Brownjohn in Issue 6 (May 1960) comparing Creeley and Philip Larkin. *Migrant* was also eclectic in a formal sense, publishing letters, diary entries and transcriptions of tape recordings alongside the poems and reviews which more commonly feature in little magazines, an arrangement which Price describes as 'collage'.^[*Ibid*., p. 31.]

Though hardly as well-studied as the semi-legendary publications of High Modernism, the short-lived *Migrant* is often spoken of as a 'seminal' force, notable mainly for facilitating a transatlantic and intergenerational cross-fertilisation that would bear its healthiest fruit in what Eric Mottram famously called the 'British Poetry Revival 1960--1975'. If, as Brian Eno once claimed, everybody who bought a copy of the Velvet Underground's 1967 debut LP started a band, it seems equally likely that everybody who received an issue of *Migrant*---or at least the younger subscribers---became somehow involved in the running of a small press or the publication of a little magazine shortly afterwards. What is sometimes skated over in these sweeping, macro-genealogical assertions, however, is the exact form that such influence actually took. How did a magazine that ceased publication in 1960 have a significant effect on something like *The English Intelligencer*, a worksheet that wasn't started until 1966? That the similarities between Turnbull's and Andrew Crozier's ventures cannot be attributed solely to shared ancestry---the legacy of *Origin* or Creeley's *Black Mountain Review* (1954--57), for example---is clear: beyond equivalences of format and readership, there are editorial tendencies, such as the repeated inclusion of signed and unsigned correspondence, which mark the *Intelligencer* out as a direct descendant.^[Latter compares the *Intelligencer* to Stan Persky's *Open Space* (1964) (Latter, *Late Modernism*, p. 43). While that publication's low-budget aesthetic and explicitly geographical focus were certainly important influences, the tendency to cite it as a lone progenitor in the same breath as the *Intelligencer*---see statements in articles by Drew Milne ('Agoraphobia, and the embarrassment of manifestos: notes towards a community of risk', *Parataxis*, 3 [1993], 25--39 [p. 35]) and Nigel Wheale ('Breaking Cover: Peter Riley's "Passing Measures"', *Chicago Review*, 47.1 [2001], 110--17 [p. 112])---risks obscuring equally important forbears: not only *Migrant*, but other mimeographed organs such as *The Floating Bear* (1961--69), a publication whose influence Latter also acknowledges (Latter, *Late Modernism*, pp. 40--42). That the *Open Space* comparison seems to have originated with Peter Riley, the *Intelligencer*'s second editor, supports the case for caution (Riley, 'A Commentary on the Serial Poems of Jack Spicer' [unpublished M.A. thesis, University of Keele, 1975], p. 155).] Yet the actual bridges of influence across the above-mentioned six-year gap remain obscure.
One example of such a bridge is *Satis*. Edited by Matthew Mead, *Satis* was published from Newcastle upon Tyne by Malcolm Rutherford, who would continue to issue books and pamphlets under the imprint well into the 1980s. Its first issue appeared in the autumn of 1960 with an editorial announcing baldly that 'Satis exists to publish poems', before clarifying that '[w]e cannot specify in advance the poetry we want---and for which we cannot pay---but can only promise to recognise that poetry when we see it' ('Editorial', *Satis*, 1 [1960], p. 2^[Subsequent inline citations of *Satis* editorials have been suppressed---they can all be found on p. 2 of their relevant issues.]). This recognition principle seems to have operated smoothly from the very beginning: the contents page for the first issue includes a well-filtered list of *Migrant*-affiliated poets---Turnbull, Michael Shayer, Anselm Hollo---as well as the comparatively well-known John Heath-Stubbs and a few outliers such as the Belgo-Irish poet Anne Cluysenaar and the American Frederick Eckman, known for his involvement with the *Golden Goose* magazine and chapbook series in the 1940s and '50s. The only name that seems to have fallen out of circulation is Anthony Smythe. Miller and Price describe *Satis* as 'rather restrained', noting a possible explanation for the title ('just "enough", and no more').^[David Miller and Richard Price, *British Poetry Magazines, 1914--2000* (London: British Library, 2006), p. 195. The immediate source of the term can be found in the motto printed on the inside cover of each issue: '*Satis.* Enough. *This remark written with the finger on the surface of an unbaked brick may mean either that the brick was the last of any particular batch; or it may be an idle remark made by the workman . . . . .* ---description alongside an inscribed Roman brick in the Silchester collection, Reading Museum'.] Nevertheless, the magazine's smart red cover and duodecimo format set it apart from the general pool of mimeographed and stapled organs, as does the professionally typeset and photolithographed content: sticking fairly rigidly to its stated mission, 'to publish poems', *Satis* might seem to have more in common with a well-presented university publication than with an avant-garde clearing house like *Migrant*.^[Aside from the editorials, the only exceptions to the 'Satis exists to publish poems' rule were regular short essays on individual poets, generally contributors.] This suspicion is confirmed by the editorials appearing on p. 2 of each issue, the tone of which is resolutely undergraduate---a message in Issue 2 (Spring 1961) notes that '[t]he publisher of this magazine reserves the right to disagree with any editorial statement which he may, eventually, understand', while Issue 3 (Summer 1961) acknowledges '[t]hose who despair of these editorials'.

The fifth and final issue of *Satis* appeared in the summer of 1962, at which point it ceased publication for what the issue's editorial describes as 'adequate reasons of love, money and lassitude'. This statement represents the apotheosis of a sort of commercial paranoia that had pervaded *Satis* from its very first issue. The initial editorial, for instance, jokingly invites '[h]eavy investments in [*Satis*'s] non-interest-bearing stock', while Issue 2 follows a request for subscriptions with the statement that '[c]heques, etc. should be made payable to the publisher. The publisher is under constant surveillance' (p. 1). Concerns about money are in fact most legible in the regular statements from the publisher printed on the magazine's inside cover. The first of these exhorts the reader, somewhat optimistically, to '[s]ave 12 of these tokens from successive Satis covers and win a sporting rifle for the office', with subsequent messages generally following the 'token' format: while Issue 2's message is a betting tip, Issue 3's 'will admit bearer to the publisher's lecture: *The Evils of Gambling*', presumably a reference to the magazine's inability to cover its costs. Issue 4 offers to let '[t]he reader with the most Satis tokens [...] ghostwrite the sensational memoirs of the publisher', while Issue 5 promises to 'admit the bearer' to a spurious 'Satis Closing-down dinner'. More interesting than the sheer fact of *Satis*'s demise are the administrative arrangements which accompanied it. Having sold 6/- (\$1.20) subscriptions promising three issues each (and offering no discount on the 2/- [\$0.40] cover price), Mead and Rutherford effectively owed many of their readers a sixth issue. The solution to the problem was given in the final issue's editorial:

> We are indebted to J. H. Prynne, the Editor of *Prospect*, for agreeing to our suggestion that subscriptions which would not have expired until our sixth number should be filled by *Prospect*. All subscriptions which run beyond that point will be returned. Any malcontent to whom this arrangement is not agreeable should write to us at once. We are sharpening everything.

As has been described above, *Prospect* 6 did not in fact appear until 1964, and the combination of extremely high production values and a limited budget made it the last in the series; nevertheless, the fact that it was deemed suitable literally to replace *Satis* says a lot about the connections between the two publications. Just as in Prynne's relations with *Origin*, it is difficult to imagine a closer form of association between periodicals than the exchange of a subscriber list, this being the almost-contractual expression of goodwill (financial or otherwise) that makes a project possible in the first place. Arguably, when individual issues and volumes are stripped away, a periodical actually *is* its subscriber list, a principle taken to an extreme by *The English Intelligencer*, which regularly printed lists of its recipients. Prynne contributed two poems to *Satis* 5, 'Early Yesterday Morning' and 'In Praise'. Setting aside the juvenilia described in the previous section, these rank among his very earliest published poems; yet the fact that both works were subsequently included in *Force of Circumstance* makes drawing threads of influence from *Satis* to later stages in Prynne's career---the period of his involvement with the *Intelligencer*, for example---a risky enterprise. At this point, then, it will be important to provide some more details about *Mica*, the second magazine under examination here, before considering whether its links to Prynne imply a stronger claim to relevance.

*Mica*'s status as an heir to *Migrant* is undoubtedly better-established than that of *Satis*---in his 2007 article 'Migrant the Magnificent', Price describes the publication as a 'direct successor', while the finding aid for the Mica Collection at SUNY Buffalo notes that it was '[m]odeled after Gael Turnbull's magazine'.^[Price, p. 33; 'Finding aid for the Mica Collection, 1960--1962', *University at Buffalo, The State University of New York*, \<http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu:8080/findingaids/view?docId=ead/poetry/ubpo\_pcms0007.xml\> [accessed 27 March 2014].] Part of the reason for this may lie in the obvious similarities of format: mimeographed from typewritten stencils and folded crosswise, *Mica* clearly maintains the low-budget aesthetic established by the older publication. Edited jointly from the University of California, Santa Barbara by German and French emigrés Helmut Bonheim and Raymond Federman, the magazine managed to preserve some of *Migrant*'s transatlantic character, though in linguistic terms the content remains anglocentric. It also maintained very similar commercial arrangements, with subscriptions based entirely on donations: just as the first issue of *Migrant* declared that 'even a few stamps will be of help' (*Migrant*, 1 [1959], p. 18), *Mica* implores readers to 'send us dollars or even stamps to help defray the expense of production and mailing in the coming year' (*Mica*, 1 [1960], p. 5). *Mica*'s first issue appeared in December 1960, shortly after *Satis*'s debut, and the magazine ran for a total of seven issues, the final one being published in November 1962. While Bonheim and Federman generally eschewed direct editorializing, the inaugural issue includes an important 'Note from the Editors' which makes the *Migrant* connection explicit: 'In the belief that Gael Turnbull's MIGRANT stood among the best and most readable of the little magazines, the editors of MICA want to continue in its footsteps' (p. 4). Having made this hereditary claim, the note sets out some of the magazine's principles, including a commitment to 'the publication of non-genre pieces: sections of letters, journals, notes, remarks, and uncompleted pieces of interesting fiction.' The 'modesty of our present format' is, meanwhile, presented as 'a positive virtue: our contributors will probably be interested in finding discriminating readers rather than the flattery of a glossy publication' (pp. 4--5). This sense of provisionality, a far cry from *Satis*'s professional veneer, is reaffirmed by a quotation printed underneath the opening note and taken from an anonymous letter to *Migrant* 8:

> I think it is essential to regard the little magazine as semi-private, and not a self-sufficient world in itself. More like theatre in rehearsal than the presented performance. It is a kind of preparation for other things, a place where one can make one's mistakes and push forward one's tentative shoots both to one's own use and to those of the few others who can benefit from seeing them tried. But it is all subordinate to the ultimate break-through.

Prynne's contributions to *Mica* are more extensive than his contributions to *Satis*, a fact which is at least partly attributable to geography: given his position at Harvard, correspondence with the American magazine would presumably have been cheaper. A selection of *Force of Circumstance*-era poems in Issues 2 (February 1961) and 3 (June 1961) is followed by an extract from a letter in *Mica* 5 (Winter 1962) and a further poem, subsequently uncollected, in Issue 6 (June 1962). Of these, it is the letter, which occasioned responses in *Mica* 6 from both Theodore Enslin and Larry Eigner, that is of most immediate interest. Signed 'J.H. Prynne, Outer Hebrides', it presents his thoughts on the current state of American poetry, which he contrasts with 'the deliberately small aims and over-developed musculature of most English writers of verse' (*Mica*, 5 [1962], p. 3). Prynne is simultaneously laudatory and cautious, describing recent American work as 'a vast achievement' but warning that it too often 'offer[s] substitutes for experience instead of modes of access.' There are clear parallels between Prynne's concerns in this letter to *Mica*, which concludes with an exhortation to '[work] every preposition into the final contours of the poem and the shape of its own defining' (p. 28), and the argument that he puts forward in 'Resistance and Difficulty', published the previous year in *Prospect*, which will be discussed in detail at the end of this chapter. 

Like *Satis*, then, *Mica* is linked to *Prospect* through Prynne, though the poetic work that he contributed to both magazines would subsequently be disowned. Using the open source statistical computing software R, it is possible to represent these relationships visually, a process which also helps to illuminate broader patterns in what was earlier described as *Migrant*'s 'transatlantic and intergenerational cross-fertilisation'. Figure @fig:mmsp shows a force-directed graph generated using the Fruchterman--Reingold algorithm and an adjacency matrix of contributors to *Migrant*, *Mica*, *Satis* and *Prospect*.^[The adjacency matrix was generated in R using a simple spreadsheet listing contributors (rows) and magazines (columns), where a '1' recorded presence in a given magazine and a '0' absence. This, in turn, was compiled by hand using the original contents pages of the respective magazines. For the purposes of analysis, all editors have been recorded as contributors to their own magazines, even when---as in the case of Gael Turnbull---they only printed their own work pseudonymously. Poets in translation, poets not alive at the time of publication and illustrators have not been counted as contributors, while translators and contributors of concrete poetry have. Fruchterman--Reingold is one of a family of algorithms used to generate force-directed graphs---it functions by simultaneously simulating attractive forces along each edge (much like springs or elastic) and more general repulsive forces between vertices. The final result shows this system in a state of equilibrium, with closely-linked vertices clustered together and weaker links further apart.] Each point (or 'vertex') represents a contributor, while the lines (or 'edges') indicate publication in the same magazine. It is clear at a glance that the links between these publications take the form of a series of clusters. Aside from the obvious groups representing contributors to only one magazine each, there are smaller gatherings at specific bridge points. The largest of these intermediate groups is that which spans *Migrant* and *Mica*, comprising Roy Fisher, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Edwin Morgan and five others---indeed, the strength of the connection between the two magazines, hypothesized from subjective evidence above, shows up clearly on the graph as a thick, grey band. This group is followed closely by a relatively clear *Migrant*--*Mica*--*Satis* cluster, which includes a number of key names: Gael Turnbull, Anselm Hollo, Matthew Mead, Larry Eigner and Barriss Mills. Arguably of more interest, statistically and historically, are the smaller pairs or groups of three which spin off from these two main networks. It is instructive to note, for example, that Olson, Dorn and Tomlinson---all important influences on Prynne---occupy virtually identical positions on the graph, connected directly to *Migrant* and *Prospect* but only indirectly to *Mica* and *Satis*. Likewise, the personal and poetic connections between Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov show up visually, as do the milieu shared by Michael Shayer and Godfrey John and the relative outsider status of Charles Bukowski and David Rafael Wang (no presence in *Migrant* or *Prospect*, but adopted temporarily by both *Mica* and *Satis*). Prynne himself occupies a highly central position, which is to be expected given the fundamental bias of the network, the magazines having been selected on the basis of his involvement in the first place.

![Contributors to *Migrant*, *Mica*, *Satis* and *Prospect*](figs/mmsp.png){#fig:mmsp}

Further insight into the relationships between the key magazines of this period can be gained by studying their links more directly---for instance, by counting the absolute numbers of shared contributors. This reveals that the number of contributors connecting *Migrant* to *The Resuscitator*, *Prospect* or *The Wivenhoe Park Review* is in virtually every case as high as or higher than that connecting *Mica* or *Satis* in the same direction, even when only the post-*Migrant* issues of *Prospect* are counted.^[The exception is the link connecting *The Wivenhoe Park Review* with *Mica* (five contributors), which is slightly stronger than the corresponding link with *Migrant* (four contributors). Both include important names: Olson and Dorn in the latter, Tom Raworth and Prynne in the former.] While this doesn't completely put paid to the 'bridging' thesis set out above, it does suggest that *Mica* and *Satis* are more than just temporary waypoints on a smooth journey from *Migrant* to later publications: rather than simply ferrying poets across a chronological gap, they strike out into new territory. This analysis is, of course, distorted by the varying absolute sizes of the contributor lists---the more contributors a magazine has overall, the more likely it is to share at least some of those contributors with another publication. Even so, this effect is both less pronounced than might be expected (*Mica* and *The Wivenhoe Park Review*, the two magazines with the longest contributor lists, have only the ninth strongest bond) and analytically significant in itself: if a magazine has a short contributor list but a high number of shared contributors, as in the case of *Migrant*, that says something important about its relation to the network as a whole.

From the perspective of the literary historian, these short-lived publications are worth studying for their own innovations and their divergent contributions to the Anglo-American poetic avant garde; but they also played the equally important role of 'keeping the flame alive' during 1960--62, providing venues in which the messy business of an already-established poetic tradition could continue to take place. This function would prove to be particularly important for younger poets like Prynne. Despite the fact that his poetic contributions to both magazines were subsequently collected and discarded as *Force of Circumstance*, Prynne's engagement with *Mica* and *Satis* is important in other ways. In the case of the former, his mixed poetic/prosaic practice in its pages is a clear precursor to later interactions with publications from *The English Intelligencer* to *Grosseteste Review* to *Rolling Stock*; on the other hand, the merging of *Satis* into *Prospect* and Prynne's editorship of the latter must have offered valuable practical experience in managing the sorts of headstrong personalities characteristic of the little magazine scene---experience which would prove particularly useful five years later, when in December 1967 Prynne, Crozier and John James removed Peter Riley as editor of the *Intelligencer*. If it makes sense to speak in market terms about a field of production so self-consciously non-commercial (and an event like the transfer of subscriptions from *Satis* to *Prospect* suggests that this might not be as incongruous as it seems), then *Mica* and *Satis* can be seen, finally, as functions of poetic supply and demand, filling a temporary gap in the market---and making use of the limited amount of freedom afforded by this position---before being displaced in their turn.^[Of course, demand is a concept of limited explanatory value in a market where 'consumers' are, more often than not, also producers; rather than a demand for actual poetic commodities, what it might end up designating is a demand for the literary infrastructure used to circulate those commodities. This seems even more true of the world of avant-garde/small-press poetry than it is of poetry in general, though an optimist might hope that the famous dictum that 'more people write poetry than read it' tends more towards an even balance in the case of the former.] Describing the situation in 1960, Price notes that '[*Migrant*] may have closed, but this was because the scene, as it were, had now been set: books themselves were to carry on the Migrant idea.'^[Price, p. 32.] The truth in this statement needs to be acknowledged. Some chapbooks and pamphlet series are in formal terms---taking into account the material conditions of their production and the 'production values' thereby implied---practically indistinguishable from little magazines, while even more substantial books from small presses can offer zones of provisionality and experiment of the sort more commonly found in periodicals. Still, Price's assertion ultimately invites a response of 'yes, but': to focus exclusively on books as the carriers of 'the Migrant idea'---a communal project whose internal rifts and asymmetries must, of course, be interrogated in their own right---would be to ignore the important bridging work done by short-lived, 'liminal' organs like *Mica* and *Satis*, even as they pursued other avenues of experiment.
