A powerful example both of the young Prynne's negotiation of interlocking literary obligations and of the usefulness of biographical data to literary analysis is provided by an uncollected early poem, a translation of Guido Cavalcanti's sonnet *Chi è questa*:

> Who is it, that  
> in coming thus is  
> so admired  

> the air lucid  
> with shaking  
> brightness  

> beside her  
> the very person  
> of love?  

> No man may  
> speak, except  
> to sigh  

> the turning glance!  
> love must say  
> that, not I  

> such containment  
> makes those around  
> her seem gestures, of rage  

> she gathers the  
> virtues to her  
> finest pleasing : no 

> words show her  
> goddess  
> of beauty 

> such height  
> the mind  
> has not known  

> nor such favour  
> that ever, truly  
> we might^[Prynne, 'Chi É', *Prospect*, 6 (Spring 1964), p. 35.]

This is not a work which came down to Prynne unfiltered from the *Duecento*: translated twice by Pound, it is discussed at length in Chapter VI of Donald Davie's *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*, parts of which 'derive immediately from conversations with J.H. Prynne'.^[Donald Davie, *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*, p. vi. Mellors goes so far as to claim that the chapter was 'written with [Prynne's] assistance' (Mellors, p. 73). It was in any case published in 1964, the same year as Prynne's translation.] Davie quotes Pound's translations---the first from 1912, the second from 1929---in full, 'tak[ing] for granted that [the latter] is more to modern taste', then attempts to explain why.^[Davie, *Ezra Pound*, p. 105. Pound's translations were first published respectively in Pound, *Sonnets and Ballate of Guido Cavalcanti* (London: Stephen Swift and Co., 1912), p. 29 and Pound, 'Guido's Relations', *The Dial*, 86 (July 1929), 559--68 (p. 56).] The chief differences between the two, as identified by Davie, are a shift from relatively strict pentameter to a more varied metrical pattern, and a shift from Standard English diction and orthography with the occasional archaic abbreviation (''tis', 'ne'er') to an entirely archaic mode of presentation reminiscent of 16th-century English poets such as Thomas Wyatt ('makyng the air to tremble with a bright clearenesse'). Davie cites Pound's own denunciation in *Make it New* of the 'prevalent error [...] of dealing with Italian hendecasyllables as if they were English "iambic pentameter"', along with his assertion that 'Dante's hendecasyllables were composed of combinations of rhythm units of various shapes and sizes'.^[Pound, 'Cavalcanti', in *Literary Essays of Ezra Pound*, ed. by T.S. Eliot (London: Faber and Faber, 1954), 149--200 (p. 169).] 'Although Pound goes on to claim that he had discovered this for himself "in Indiana"', writes Davie, 'his versions of 1912 do not suggest as much.'^[Davie, *Ezra Pound*, p. 106.] Having further compared this use of 'rhythm units' to Pound's practice in the Chinese translations of *Cathay* (1915), Davie draws the following conclusion:

> Because for purposes of polemic Pound chose at times to play the iconoclast, it is easy to see his abandonment of the traditional pentameter as something deliberate and programmatic; his translations of Cavalcanti from 1912 onwards suggest on the contrary that he broke with the pentameter reluctantly, grudgingly, and, as it were, of necessity.^[*Ibid*., p. 107.]

In the case of archaism, Davie pays attention specifically to l. 10 of the original---'*Ch'a lei s'inchina ogni gentil vertute*'---translated by Pound as 'For all the noble powers bend toward her' and 'In that every high noble vertu leaneth to herward'. He refers again to criticism, noting how in the introduction to *Sonnets and Ballate* Pound dissents from Dante Gabriel Rossetti's rendering, 'To whom are subject all things virtuous.' In the Italian, according to Pound, '"she" acts as a magnet for every "gentil virtute," that is, the noble spiritual power, the invigorating forces of life and beauty bend toward her'; Rossetti errs in failing to emphasise this active movement.^[Pound, *Sonnets and Ballate*, p. 5.] As Davie points out,

> [i]n both of Pound's versions this meaning of *s'inchina* is duly reproduced[. ...] But it is in the later version that the point is rammed home, that the difference between Rossetti's version and Pound's is made irreconcilable. This is a function of the much denser and more conspicuous archaism of the revised version; in other words, the much heavier archaism of the second version is not for the sake of loftiness and ornateness, but, on the contrary, it serves to cleave more closely to the sense as Pound perceives it.^[Davie, *Ezra Pound*, pp. 108--09.] 

How, if at all, does Prynne's translation fit into this narrative of progress provided by Davie? Its most obvious departure is formal. Where Pound's versions follow the two-quatrain, two-tercet layout of the original, Prynne's is composed of ten tercets, with very short lines of between two and five words. These lines are a clear attempt to replicate the 'rhythm units of various shapes and sizes' described by Pound, yet in a new arrangement. In translating *Chi è questa*, Pound avoids marking these units formally, though he does so in his version of Cavalcanti's *Donna mi prega* by 'spacing out the line in print, making it float or step across, as well as down, the printed page'.^[*Ibid*., p. 112. As Davie notes, this is a technique now more closely associated with the work of William Carlos Williams, who nevertheless 'seized' it from Pound.] Prynne goes one further, 'breaking the pentameter' almost completely by denying any possibility of its reconstitution through left-right eye movement.^[Of the poem's ten stanzas, only two contain exactly ten syllables, the rest ranging from seven to 14.] The significance of this arrangement is revealed by the later stages of Davie's chapter, in which he discusses an apparent contradiction: enjambment, as the 'metrical sign of kinetic energy, of impetus', requires a relatively consistent metrical structure as a backdrop, something which is disrupted by the 'rhythmical dismemberment of the verse line from within' which Pound sought.^[*Ibid*., p. 118.] According to Davie, Pound's translations therefore lack consistent movement, petrifying into individual lines; writing of 'South-Folk in Cold Country' from *Cathay*, he claims that 'of the lines in this poem it seems more accurate to say that they are placed one beneath another, than to say that one comes after another.'^[*Ibid*.] There can be few clearer examples of lines 'placed one beneath another' than Prynne's version of *Chi è questa*; yet it is also a poem which is relentlessly enjambed, including by a dramatic jump over the seventh stanza break. This ambiguous 'no', which in its spatial detachment from what follows risks negating the preceding three lines, reads as a deliberate attempt both to outstrip Pound and to prove Davie wrong: to combine enjambment with 'rhythmical dismemberment' in something completely new. At the same time, its separation from 'words show her' allows the whole phrase to be semantically inverted in a moment of textual self-consciousness unprecedented in previous translations: words *do* show her, including at this very moment. This in turn implies something important about what sort of a thing 'she', the 'goddess of beauty', is---namely, a factitious textual construction which is in fact highly amenable to being shown through words.

Nor does Prynne's poem map in any consistent way on to the structure of the original. While the first four tercets neatly represent the first four lines in Cavalcanti, the poem roughly doubles in 'speed' after this point, condensing each of the subsequent three stanzas into two tercets. Ideas from Cavalcanti are also re-ordered: in the original version of the passage quoted above, the conventional expression of incommunicability comes before the section about the virtues. Some of the telescoping of source material is extreme: l. 13 of Prynne's piece, 'the turning glance!', substitutes for a much more semantically complex section, rendered in the later Pound as 'Ah God, what she is like when her owne eye turneth'. Keeping a de-archaised version of the 1929 'turneth' in preference to 1912's 'strays', Prynne nevertheless distils the entire apostrophe to God into an exclamation mark and completely loses the reference to semblance, which in 1912 leads Pound into the unidiomatic 'The thing she's like'. Prynne makes similarly free with the basic grammar of crucial phrases. His implicit intervention in the one-sided dispute between Pound and Rossetti over *s'inchina* is typically blunt: Prynne completely reverses the phrase, transferring grammatical agency from the virtues which 'lean', 'turn' or are 'subject', to the woman who 'gathers' them---she becomes a subject herself. In simplifying grammar, Prynne introduces subtle semantic modifications, as in ll. 25--27: 'such height | the mind | has not known'. 'Has not', here, is a significant step down from '*non fu sì alta già*' or Pound's 'ne'er before'/'never before', losing the implication that whatever hasn't been achieved in the past is in fact being achieved now. In Prynne's text, the mind might simply never reach such height. This sense actually corresponds more strictly to the overall meaning of the stanza, and makes possible the poem's final shift: 'nor such favour | that ever, truly | we might' (ll. 28--30). The use of the 'nor' from Pound's 1929 translation disguises a much quicker and cleaner transition from past to future conditional than in the older poet's version, some syntactical complexity notwithstanding. For Prynne, the mind has not (in the past) known such height, nor has it known such favour that we might ever (in the future) truly know such height. As Davie points out, Pound vacillates between reading '*in voi*' and '*in noi*' in the penultimate line of the original, causing the address to change radically.^[*Ibid.*, pp. 105--06.] Prynne completely avoids this issue; the female subject is indeed absent from Prynne's poem by this stage, allowing the focus to settle finally on 'we', the complex formed by the reader and speaker.

As part of his determination to transform rather than simply to translate Cavalcanti's poem, Prynne deliberately avoids the archaic diction which Davie praises in Pound. Whereas in Davie's assessment 'the much heavier archaism of the second version [...] serves to cleave more closely to the sense as Pound perceives it', Prynne aims for a different sort of accuracy---as the *s'inchina* issue shows, he is not afraid to depart from Pound even when that also means departing from Cavalcanti.^[*Ibid*, p. 109.] Prynne's vocabulary is, then, almost universally mono- or disyllabic, the sole exception being 'containment' in l. 16, a word which serves as a useful test of his principle of selection. Taken for Cavalcanti's  *umiltà*, 'containment' is a seemingly inappropriate choice, the former deriving ultimately from the Latin *humilitas*, literally the quality of being close to the ground (*humus*). The development of *umiltà* into *omertà*, with its connotations of organisational secrecy and exclusiveness, may provide one way back to Prynne's usage, as might the modern English injunction to 'contain oneself'. More important, however, is the sound link with the etymologically and semantically unrelated *cotanto* in the original line, '*Cotanto d'umiltà donna mi pare*': through careful selection, Prynne induces an echo across languages and centuries, without sacrificing the sleekness and 'containment' of his own poem. The introduction of 'those around' in the following line---'such containment | makes those around | her seem gestures, of rage' (ll. 16--18)---siphons off the word's remaining obtrusiveness, making it part of a broader spatial structure, a system of interiors and exteriors.

In translating *Chi è questa*, Prynne could hardly have selected a poem more heavily freighted with both literary-historical and personal significance, already translated not once but twice by the totemic father of poetic modernism and discussed at length by his own sometime *Doktorvater* in *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*. The translation's significance is further heightened by its appearance in Issue 6 of *Prospect*, a publication whose aesthetic importance for Prynne as editor was described at length in Chapter 2. (The poem in fact appears on the page without any suggestion that it is a translation, the reader's familiarity with its convoluted history being taken for granted.) The four poems of Prynne's included in *Prospect* 6 are sandwiched tightly between work by Olson and Davie, the two influences most frequently acknowledged in introductions to Prynne's work. They are far from being homogenous, however: 'Chi É' is in fact markedly different in style from its neighbours, all three of which read like offcuts from *Force of Circumstance*, sharing that volume's concern for the natural world and commitment to relatively conventional stanza forms.^[While they certainly show more of Olson's influence than some of the poems in *Force of Circumstance*, 'Salt Water, Fresh Water', 'At the Dark Centre' and 'Lie of the Other Land' were all read by Prynne for a recording accompanying his 1964 interview with Peter Orr; all of the other poems read were taken from his debut collection.] In summary, then, *Chi è questa*  was carefully and deliberately selected, its translation composed in a strategically audacious style and published in a manner which ensured that it stood out, Prynne himself having absolute control over presentation. It is thus a rare and important instance of near-explicit acknowledgement on Prynne's part of poetic influence and inheritance, phenomena which more often remain subterranean presences in his work, and even in his correspondence. This perhaps accounts for the fact that 'Chi É' has never been collected in *Poems*, sharing this status with *Force of Circumstance*---a volume heavily indebted both to Davie and to Charles Tomlinson---and a handful of other individual pieces.
