# 'The idea of perfection'


## i. Introduction

The preceding chapters introduced contexts for Prynne's career through consideration of his critical, theoretical and historical prose. It was pointed out that Prynne is not merely a poet, though this is undoubtedly the work for which he is most well-known, but also a critic, a teacher and an editor, and that this variety of activities is reflected in the various pieces of prose work that he produced between the mid-1950s and the mid-1970s. The present chapter will see a change both in content and in methodology, considering Prynne's relationship to a form that---leaving aside an arguable exception which will be considered in the fifth section of this chapter---he has never actually practised: fiction. This does not, however, mean that the argument will be unable to draw upon primary texts by Prynne. While Prynne has never written---or, at least, never published---conventional prose fiction himself, he has certainly produced texts which comment on the fiction of others, often in great detail. These most often take the form of private letters, either to the subjects of the commentary or to third parties, but Prynne has also published at least one formal review of a novel, as well as public letters and less formal comments. Beyond assessing Prynne's attitude to fiction in general, this chapter will investigate a number of similarities between prose texts that Prynne has professed to admire, proposing a third context for his work, akin to the nexus of Leavisite criticism and Movement poetry discussed in Chapter 1 or the avant-garde little magazine scene explored in the first half of Chapter 2. It will go on to draw broader conclusions about Prynne's basic ethical and aesthetic stance, building on the reading of 'A Note on Metal' offered in the second half of that chapter. Specifically, a gap will be traced between two styles in Prynne's prose work---one reasoned and deliberate, the other vitriolic and dismissive---which will then be reconnected through their shared advocacy of a number of implicitly aesthetic qualities, most notably sexual maturity.

The list of novelists mentioned by Prynne in his letters of the 1960s and '70s is long, but not perhaps as long as might be expected; certainly, it is dwarfed by the number of poets mentioned. This manageability makes it relatively easy to identify authors who appear more than once, or with whom Prynne corresponded directly, suggesting that he was particularly interested in their work. This restricted list may be divided into three main categories: Prynne's avant-garde contemporaries in Britain (Tony Ward, Douglas Oliver); American writers associated loosely with the Black Mountain group (Ed Dorn, Douglas Woolf); and older figures with whom Prynne is unlikely to have had any personal connection (Wyndham Lewis, Edward Upward). In-keeping with this thesis's focus on British contexts for Prynne's work, this chapter will concentrate on the first and the third of these groups, leaving aside Tony Ward, whose novels are generally only mentioned by Prynne in passing, or in conversations about the practicalities of publication.^[For instance, in an early letter to Olson, Prynne mentions that Ward is 'writing his second (totally ignored) novel', but provides no details about the work (Prynne to Olson, 14 February 1962).] The relationship between the three remaining names---Wyndham Lewis, Douglas Oliver and Edward Upward---is, it will be argued, roughly triangular, in the sense that there are a number of strong similarities between Lewis and Upward, Upward and Oliver, and Oliver and Lewis, but only weaker ones between all three figures at once. In some cases, the relationship is one of direct influence: Upward has stated explicitly, albeit with prompting, that 'Wyndham Lewis [...] influenced me considerably', and a very specific, concrete connection will be made between sections of Upward's and Oliver's work; in others, the link rests more on the shared use of certain literary techniques.^[Edward Upward, 'Answers to questions from David Lambourne', p. 4.] Through an examination of Prynne's recorded comments on each author, this chapter will attempt to clarify both this structure and the relationship between Prynne and prose fiction to which it corresponds.


## ii. Wyndham Lewis

Prynne's most significant comments on Wyndham Lewis come at an important stage in his correspondence with Peter Riley, shortly before the extended remarks on prose which were discussed in Chapter 2. Writing to Riley on 23 June 1967, Prynne expresses exasperation with the latest issue of *The English Intelligencer*, which he has been helping to produce. Its 'effect', he claims, 'is of a somewhat parochial and *second-hand* youthfulness: most of the tedious embarrassments of youth without any of the original energy of (a) not having read anything except the great classics of the past, or (b) of having read with profit & intelligent insight the writing of the present.'^[Prynne to Riley, 23 June 1967.] The *Intelligencer* poets are, according to Prynne, doubly vapid, completely disengaged from literary tradition: 'There is really no option about it:- either a man like [David] Grubb must read Milton & Pound, or he must prove that he doesn't need to. Otherwise, the level of childishness is just too high altogether.' Having blasted Grubb, Prynne moves on to the long-running conversation in the pages of the *Intelligencer* about poetic language and historical experience, a conversation to which 'A Note on Metal' had been a significant contribution. He describes either the latest public interventions in this debate---made by Tim Longville, David Chaloner, Jim Philip and Riley himself---or the contents of a previous letter from Riley, as 'arguments about syllabic and epistemic nicety, that we touch with equal conscience on the fall of speech and the localities of our experience'. Prynne goes on to declare that 'this is surely an ethic which we can now simply presume':

> That subject-object dialectic is just part of our remorse at consorting so intimately with language quite as much as with the natural aspect. & it's part of our history too, & I would hold myself that we can best regard the problem in that form as *superseded*, i.e. we have moved on from that apparent impasse, the syntax & phenomenology of *regard* (in both senses, including regard *for*) is a French and American pre-occupation which charmingly attests their respective old-fashionedness.

The absence of Riley's side of the correspondence clouds our understanding of Prynne's argument here; nevertheless, what he seems to be saying is that the mutually constitutive nature of language and experience is a phenomenon which, by 1967, is no longer an interesting or profitable subject of discussion, at least in its basic form. The 'subject-object dialectic' which lies behind arguments about poets' relation to history, in particular, is, Prynne suggests, merely a symptomatic outgrowth of the use of language itself---and this is something which poets should by now be able to assume.

Prynne's argument may be clarified through reference to a previous letter, dated roughly one month earlier. Here, Prynne rails against what he terms ('with crisp French melodrama') '*the public exclusion of freedom*'.^[Prynne to Riley, 29 May 1967.] He is referring to emerging structuralist modes of analysis---notably the anthropology of Claude Lévi-Strauss---which, according to Prynne, promote the 'idea that originary history defined the world by limiting the choice of language (and conduct) within it'. Later, he states explicitly that 'Lévi-Strauss [...] synchronises our use of the past into types and thus settles a wire-mesh of structural probabilities around our prospect of the future.' The language of restriction here is very similar to Francis Wolff's invocation of the 'transparent cage', as quoted by Meillassoux, and though it refers to the structure of language rather than strictly to the correlationist circle, Prynne can be seen to tack closer to the latter in his denunciation of the 'subject-object dialectic' above.^[At another point in the 29 May letter, Prynne makes a plea for 'something better that [*sic*] mind/body, past/present dualisms, which arouse all manner of social antagonisms without more than touching on the issue.'] As in Chapter 2, while starting from a problematic which is similar in structure---and certainly similarly felt and expressed---Prynne diverges wildly from Meillassoux in his prescriptions, ignoring 'some generative idea of contingency' in favour of a 'tactic of *refusal* [which] is part Romantic/Anarchist'. Importantly, this abrupt and practically unargued defence of free choice---history being 'the language by which we implicate ourselves [...] into a *chosen* diffidence about the future'---is linked directly to fiction: 'the past at any point cannot be a new kind of present unless it's taken up through narrative, fictive and not polemic'. This would seem directly to contradict the attitude expressed in contemporary letters to Riley, notably that of 15 September 1967 which was discussed in the conclusion to Chapter 2. Here, though he does not use the word 'polemic', Prynne appeals explicitly to '*opinion*' and 'the inter-modifying force of open *argument*', advocating a rewriting of Shelley which cannot be anything but polemical. Unless the opinions expressed in Prynne's correspondence are to be considered wildly inconsistent, then, his comments in May must be taken to refer to a different type or level of prose than his comments in September. Polemic is what is needed temporarily to kick-start the *Intelligencer*, but fiction---or 'fictive narrative'---is what is ultimately required to make the past 'a new kind of present'.

Prynne goes on to substantiate his designation of 'the syntax & phenomenology of *regard*' as 'a French and American pre-occupation' by citing Alain Robbe-Grillet and Louis Zukofsky, but without any real explanation of what it is in these writers' work which conforms to his definition.^[Prynne to Riley, 23 June 1967. Zukofsky is described, confusingly, as 'an old granny who's never got beyond an essentially adolescent ethic of scruple'.] What he does suggest is a connection between the attitude described above and a pedantic, 'musical' approach to poetic language: what is wrong with Zukofsky is his concern with 'microrhetoric' and 'musical analogisings', his treatment of language as 'an old & delicate musical box [which] scatter[s] on the page [...] charming inanities'. This retreat into music is, for the anti-Paterian Prynne, a fatally unambitious reaction to 'our remorse at consorting so intimately with language', a strikingly sexual phrase by which he seems to mean paying attention to the conventionally semiotic aspects of language.^[The significance of the implicit sexualisation of this 'remorse' will become clearer below.] It is certainly not, as one correspondent in the *Intelligencer* seems to suggest, some sort of shortcut to 'the entire vital structure' of historical human experience.^['letters from David Chaloner & others', in *Certain Prose*, 119--20 (p. 120).] It is at this point that Prynne brings up Lewis. Despairing of writers who treat 'life in the world' as 'a china-shop', he notes that '[i]t's as if, for example, Wyndham Lewis had never written a line, as if *Blast* now has to be done all over again. That's of course why *Tarr* has been allowed to go out of print'. The implication here is not only of a regrettable tendency in contemporary literature but of a positive conspiracy against anything that might counter it, inattention to Lewis's 1918 novel *Tarr* being a case in point.^[Prynne's attack on unoriginality here is of course undercut by the fact that he is almost directly channeling Ezra Pound. This connection will be considered briefly below.] Prynne goes on to quote a paragraph from the book:

> 'Small as it is, I shan't get it' he thought and began repeating this stupidly and stuck at the word 'shan't.' Brain and mouth in a sluggish tangle, he stuttered thickly in his mind. He sprang up a blustering dishevelled mass, but the slovenly hopeless quality of the bed clung to him. This was a frivolous demonstration. He wandered to the window in a sulky apathy, his nose flattened against the pane, conscious of his compressed putty-grey mask, he let his gaze stream out into space.^[Wyndham Lewis, *Tarr* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 95.]

The assessment of this passage is as absolute as it is opaque, recapitulating Prynne's conspiratorial theme: 'The sheer satiric intelligence of this disposes finally of the claim that our best accuracies are musical in structure. Which of course was its intention; hence the current neglect.' It is unclear from Prynne's letter how this quotation from *Tarr* is supposed to relate to the issues which he has been discussing. In his play with dialogue, Lewis is certainly concerned with 'the fall of speech'---indeed, his construction of the deeply sibilant sentence 'Small as it is, I shan't get it' and his description of the character Otto Kreisler's looping, stuttering engagement with this particular piece of language might be described as 'microrhetoric'. Is Prynne's point, then, that a concern with the 'musicality' of language in the 1960s is outdated because it has already been done by Lewis in the 1910s, or because it has already been *satirised*? The idea that Lewis's text 'disposes finally of the claim that our best accuracies are musical in structure' would seem to suggest the latter, but it is not entirely clear that this section of *Tarr* should be read as satirical. To take another approach, does Prynne mean to suggest that the focus on Kreisler's gaze in the final sentence represents some sort of satirical attack on what he terms 'the syntax & phenomenology of regard'? Having attended Henri Bergson's lectures in Paris, Lewis was certainly familiar with contemporary philosophies of perception, but the relative infancy of Husserlian phenomenology at this point---though first published as a whole in 1918, the initial draft of *Tarr* was written from 1909--11---sets a high burden of proof on any claim about deliberate engagement, satirical or otherwise.^[As with almost any claim about *Tarr*, this is qualified by the book's complex textual history. The passage quoted by Prynne, along with much of the rest of Part II, was not included in the original serialisation of *Tarr* in *The Egoist*, 'for want of space' (*The Egoist*, 6.7 [1 July 1916], p. 107). First appearing in print in the 1918 bound Egoist Press edition (p. 103), it was subject to a number of revisions for the authoritative 1928 Chatto & Windus edition (p. 104)---principally, the addition of the clauses 'conscious of his compressed putty-grey mask, he let his gaze stream out into space'. Thus, the passage effectively straddles the emergence of phenomenology as a major philosophical discipline.] There are further possibilities: perhaps the relentlessly adjectival character of the passage, in which virtually every noun is preceded by a qualifier, is what Prynne means by 'satiric intelligence'. Yet it is just as difficult to substantiate this claim through reference to some satirised object, or even to be sure that it isn't simply an ordinary feature of Lewis's prose style, as it is with the two previously considered.

A different perspective can be gained by 'zooming out' from this particular passage to consider the general cultural significance of *Tarr* and its author, particularly in light of Prynne's pejorative reference to 'French and American pre-occupation[s]'. Following an Englishman's interactions with a series of Germans, Russians and Poles in Paris, *Tarr* is a novel obsessed with national character: as a subject, it drives not only the book's comic incidents, but also major aspects of its plot. This is a fact acknowledged by Lewis himself in the preface to the 1918 American edition, where---describing the central German character, Kreisler---he assures readers that 'I have not produced this disagreeable German for the gratification of primitive partisanship aroused by the war. On the other hand, having had him up my sleeve for so long, I let him out at this moment in the undisguised belief that he is very apposite.'^[ 'Preface to the 1918 American Edition', in *Tarr*, 285--88 (pp. 285--86).] Yet while characters such as Kreisler are subject to an extreme form of national ridicule, the same is not quite the case for the novel's protagonist, Frederick Tarr; while some play is made of Tarr's nationality, the majority of Lewis's satirical jibes against Englishness are directed at comparatively minor characters such as Hobson and Butcher, who appear in the first two chapters of the novel. This relative freedom from national stereotyping allows Tarr to become what Lewis describes as 'the individual in the book, and […] at the same time one of the showmen of the author.'^[rom the Prologue to the 1918 Egoist Press Edition', in *Tarr*, 288--89 (p. 288). Fredric Jameson offers a material basis for this status, claiming that Tarr 'dramatizes the security of the liberal and counterrevolutionary class compromise of the British tradition from the seething and politicized history of the continental states' (Fredric Jameson, *Fables of Aggression: Wyndham Lewis, the Modernist as Fascist* [Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1979], p. 95).] Tarr is not primarily 'an Englishman'---he is a man, first and foremost, and English second. 'For Tarr', notes Scott W. Klein, 'individuals without a robust sense of self become merely predictable products of their national upbringing, an assemblage of the tics and prejudices of their national ethos.'^[Scott W. Klein, 'Introduction', in *Tarr*, ix--xxix (p. xvi).] By contrast, Tarr is able to navigate the cosmopolitan environment of pre-war Paris relatively unmolested by narrative stereotyping, using his 'sense of self' to expose hypocrisy in others. As Klein points out, again, '[t]he novel balances Tarr's nominal ability to look at life objectively, "from the outside", and to separate his relationship to art from his relationship to sex, against Kreisler's increasingly clear inability to separate art from life and sexuality from violence'---similar structures are set up at the expense of other characters.^[*Ibid*., p. xiv.] This is not to say that Tarr isn't subjected to implicit criticism and even made to look ridiculous at points; merely that these moments are not coded nationally.

A similar trick of presentation can be found in the second text cited by Prynne, Lewis's short-lived but legendary little magazine *Blast*, the foundational text of Vorticism. Here, as in *Tarr*, there is an obtrusive focus on national character. References to nationhood begin in the magazine's very first text, 'Long Live the Vortex!', which contains the statement that 'great artists in England are always revolutionary, just as in France any really fine artist had a strong traditional vein.'^['Long Live the Vortex!', *Blast*, 1 (1914), [7--8] ([p. 7]).] England and France appear again in 'Manifesto---I', the famous lists of things to be 'blasted' and 'blessed', simultaneously occupying both categories, though the blasting of England is undercut by the parenthetical phrase 'from politeness', positioning it from the outset as a modest gesture made by a nation secure enough to make such gestures.^['Manifesto---I', *ibid*., 11--28 (p. 11).] The key reference to nationhood in the first issue of *Blast* comes, however, in 'Manifesto---II', the more conventional of the magazine's two opening texts.^['Manifesto---II', *ibid*., pp. 30--43.] This piece is concerned explicitly and self-consciously with what it might mean to make radically new art in England. 'We hear from America and the Continent all sorts of disagreeable things about England: "the unmusical, anti-artistic, unphilosophic country"' (II.1), writes Lewis, before reversing the expected defence: 'We quite agree' (II.2).^[I accept the conventional attribution of 'Manifesto---II' primarily to Lewis, despite the multiple signatories. Inline citations correspond to the text's individually numbered sections and theses.] He goes on to clarify his position:

> 3. Luxury, sport, the famous English 'Humour,' the thrilling ascendancy and idée fixe of Class, producing the most intense snobbery in the World; heavy stagnant pools of Saxon blood, incapable of anything but the song of a frog, in home-counties:---these phenomena give England a peculiar distinction in the wrong sense, among the nations.
4. This is why England produces such good artists from time to time.
5. This is also the reason why a movement towards art and imagination could burst up here, from this lump of compressed life, with more force than anywhere else.

Eager to prove that 'there is nothing Chauvinistic or picturesquely patriotic about our contentions' (III.1)---despite statements such as '[t]he Modern World is due almost entirely to Anglo-Saxon genius' (VI.1)---Lewis here develops a negative theory of national character: the truly revolutionary artist can only emerge from the most stultifying, infertile, old-fashioned environment, as the deliberate negation *of* that environment.^[There is a clear parallel here with the ambivalent relation between *Scrutiny* and Cambridge, discussed in Chapter 1.] Like Tarr, the vorticist painter, sculptor or poet is simultaneously English and not-English, occupying a privileged position partially inside and partially outside national identity---a vantage point which a Frenchman or a German could never hope to gain, not existing in such a violently antagonistic relation to their own culture. It is not difficult to detect a parallel here with Prynne's letters, which oscillate between scathing comments on English literary culture, as in the correspondence with Olson and Dorn discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, and comparisons which seem implicitly to privilege aspects of the English intellectual *milieu*, as in the dismissive reference to 'French and American pre-occupation[s]' considered above. In order to understand more clearly what Prynne means by this latter phrase, and by the whole argument in which it appears, this chapter will now turn to a much more deliberate and detailed consideration of a different fictional text: Douglas Oliver's *The Harmless Building*.


## iii. Douglas Oliver

First published as a joint venture by Andrew Crozier's Ferry Press and John Riley and Tim Longville's Grosseteste Review Books in 1973, *The Harmless Building* was reissued in revised form in the 1990 Paladin collection *Three Variations on the Theme of Harm*. While it is certainly not a 'conventional' book by the standards of mainstream literary fiction, it remains Douglas Oliver's only individually-authored prose novel. To an even greater extent than *Tarr*, *The Harmless Building* is structured around what Laura Steele describes as 'a rag-tag plot'; highly episodic, it is held together both by thematic elements and by the relationships and personal concerns of its three main characters: Donald (the ostensible protagonist), Rosine and Frank.^[Laura Steele, 'Comedy and the Conceptual in Douglas Oliver's *The Harmless Building*', *Intercapillary Space* (September 2006), \<http://intercapillaryspace.blogspot.co.uk/2006/09/comedy-and-conceptual-in-\ douglas.html\> [accessed 27 April 2015].] Chief among these concerns is the kidnapping of a 'mongol' (in the archaic sense referring to Down's syndrome) baby named Uncle Aubrey, a catastrophe which is accompanied by a serious railway accident and a hotel fire. Again like *Tarr*, *The Harmless Building* was written during or shortly after a prolonged stay in Paris, and there is a deep but undeferential concern with the latest developments in European, and especially French, intellectual culture. Chapter 12 begins with 'seagulls circl[ing] overhead, calling "Jacques Lacan, Jacques Lacan", without giving further details.'^[Douglas Oliver, *The Harmless Building* (London: Ferry Press and Grosseteste Review Books, 1973), p. 102; *The Harmless Building*, in *Three Variations on the Theme of Harm* (London: Paladin, 1990), 111--255 (p. 212).] The parallels between Lewis's and Oliver's work are implicitly acknowledged by Prynne in a 1972 letter to Oliver, which consists of an extended response to a pre-publication version of *The Harmless Building* and which was itself published, in amended form, in *Grosseteste Review* the following year.^[Prynne to Oliver, 9, 10 and 11 January 1972; Prynne, 'From a Letter to Douglas Oliver', *Grosseteste Review*, 6.1--4 (1973), 152--54. All quotations here are from the original letter, which bears three consecutive dates but was apparently sent in one envelope.] Describing recent poetic work by Crozier, John James, Tom Phillips, Oliver, and himself, Prynne claims that 'the Anglo team have their teeth really sunk into pain, great physical gouts of it, as opposed to the water-colour joys of the American art-gallery nympholepts. Your novel confirms this; its elegance is much too vorticist for the pre-sexual phenomenology preferred in l'Amerique du Nord.' With the latter phrase, Prynne neatly condemns both France and the United States, just as he does in the letter to Riley which positions Lewis as one of the great underappreciated figures of 20th century English literature. But is the statement in which it appears any less opaque, and can it shed any light on its predecessor?

In order to parse Prynne's argument here, it is first of all necessary to translate his terminology. The 'Anglo team' is fairly clear, referring---with a partly ironic sense of team spirit, given his more familiar pose of vitriolic criticism---to English poets formerly associated with *The English Intelligencer*, and now clustered around *Grosseteste Review* and similar publications. The identity of the 'American art-gallery nympholepts' is less immediately obvious, but it seems reasonable to assume that Prynne is referring to the so-called New York School, particularly poets such as James Schuyler, Kenneth Koch and John Ashbery, about whom he had already been thoroughly dismissive in a 1969 letter to Riley.^[As quoted in Chapter 1, Prynne describes the influence of Ashbery and his 'various camp followers' as a source of 'feeble insecurity' in some emerging English poetry (Prynne to Riley, 16 March 1969).] This reading is confirmed by Prynne's subsequent exemption of Frank O'Hara, who, he claims, 'had that pail of serpents [i.e. pain] always in view.' The *OED* gives the following definitions for 'nympholepsy': 'Passion supposedly inspired in men by nymphs; an ecstasy or yearning, esp. that caused by desire for something unattainable. Also: passion or desire aroused in men by young girls.'^['nympholepsy, n.', *OED Online* (Oxford University Press, 2015), \<http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/129422\> [accessed 28 April 2015]. Prynne seems to have been fond of the term at this point, using it again in an October 1972 letter to Dorn, though this time in reference to the residents of the York Street Commune in Vancouver, where Prynne had read in 1971 (Prynne to Dorn, 25 October 1972).] Given both the broadly homosexual character of the New York School as a group and the subsequent use of 'pre-sexual', it seems appropriate to interpret Prynne's usage in the former sense, with its emphasis on abstract unattainability. To summarise in adjectival form, then, Prynne counterposes the following:^[This table does not include 'phenomenological' as the earlier stages of the letter make clear that Oliver's novel is itself highly phenomenological; the pejorative weight in 'pre-sexual phenomenology' is assigned entirely to 'pre-sexual'.]

*English*  *French/American*
---------  -----------------
painful    water-colour
elegant    nympholeptic
vorticist  pre-sexual

The essential component of this structure seems to be something like an opposition between seriousness and frivolousness, coded in the language of sexual development. If the phenomenology preferred in 'l'Amerique du Nord' is 'pre-sexual', then that which we find in *The Harmless Building* is sexual---or, to put it more simply, adult. These terms recall Prynne's description of Zukofsky as 'adolescent' and his reference to David Grubb's 'parochial and *second-hand* youthfulness' in the letter to Riley, the implication being that certain techniques and concerns are inappropriate to a writer working in a 'mature' tradition.^[Prynne to Riley, 23 June 1967. Ironically, the second thesis of Lewis's 'Manifesto---II' calls for the establishment of a 'violent structure of adolescent clearness between two extremes' (I.2).] Oliver and Prynne are poets willing to engage with the serious, grown-up subject of pain, and to do so with a sharp, clean elegance derived partly from Vorticism; Ashbery and others are content to wallow in a state of insubstantial, water-colour yearning.

Before examining this sexualised approach to culture in relation to Edward Upward, the third novelist specified in this chapter's introduction, it will be helpful to consider some of Prynne's other comments on *The Harmless Building* in the 1972 *Grosseteste Review* letter. Prynne's interest in the novel appears at first to be primarily structural. Having described the book in terms which emphasise its coherence and solidity---'closely cross-woven and under control', 'all the tendons under multiple stress'---he describes his personal assumptions when reading it: 'I started with a Cartesian mind-body manifold, extended into a continuous 3-space along the memory/intuition/expectation timeline; this produced a three-dimensional endocrine hypersurface forming the world tube of the "novel".'^[The phrase 'world tube' is also used in Prynne's contemporaneous 'Full Tilt Botany: Ideal Weapon for Suicide Pacts' (*Bean News*, 1 [1972], p. [8]), which will be discussed in relation to *The* Plant Time Manifold *Transcripts* below.] Assuming that 'manifold' is used in the mathematical rather than the mechanical/biological sense---an assumption justified by the close proximity of allied terms such as '3-space' and 'hypersurface'---what Prynne seems to be suggesting here is that any point in *The Harmless Building* can be specified using co-ordinates on the three axes *mind*, *body* and *time* (as experienced in 'memory/intuition/expectation'). The clearest example of a manifold is the Earth, a shape which resembles Euclidean space at any given point but which requires more than one two-dimensional chart to project in full. In Prynne's example, latitude and longitude are apparently replaced by mind and body, before the whole shape is extruded along the axis of time, creating a tubular structure (see Figure 4). It is not clear why Prynne uses the term 'hypersurface', which refers to a surface with one fewer dimensions than the space in which it exists (e.g. a one-dimensional point on a two-dimensional plane, or a two-dimensional plane in a three-dimensional space)---it may simply be a terminological mistake. More interesting is the word 'endocrine', which re-emphasises the bodily nature of the structure: different points in the novel are linked to each other in an arrangement analogous to the body's endocrine system, in which glands transfer information via hormones secreted into the blood. Having set out this complex model, Prynne proceeds to complicate it further by dividing the novel into three sections: a central *récit* surrounded by *texte*, with a section of *hors-texte* at the very end. Despite being rendered in French, this terminology does not seem to correspond to any established structuralist or narratological framework---it is worth remembering that a seminal text like Gérard Genette's *Discours du récit* was only published in French in 1972, the same year in which Prynne wrote the letter. Nevertheless, it may be understood as a partly logical, partly chronological system of subordination: the *récit* consists of past events which are narrated inside the (present) *texte*, with the *hors-texte* being a short section in which the author directly addresses the readers, 'asking all of you who have read my book this far to send a donation of some kind to [learning disability charity] Mencap'.^[Oliver, *The Harmless Building*, p. 143; *Three Variations*, p. 254. This reading of Prynne's division of the novel is disputable, insofar as he describes 'Chapters 11 to 15 as texte, what follows as hors-texte', while the section of direct address described above arguably falls within Chapter 15 in both published versions of the novel. In the 1973 edition, Chapter 15 is titled 'Four Pages To Make You Feel Better', with the Mencap passage appearing on the second of these pages, underneath a sudden claim by the speaker to be talking to somebody outside the text, possibly Oliver's first wife Janet Hughes ('I'm talking to you. You were Rosine all along; you knew that. I love you. I'm sorry Tom died. I love you'); the third and fourth pages are blank. In the 1990 edition, the chapter is titled 'The Wry-Tup', and both passages flow on directly from the main body, with the following linking sentences added: 'The story, incoherent as it is, becomes complete. And then it relates to our real lives' (pp. 253--54). In both editions, Chapter 15 is followed by Chapter 16, 'Illustration of a Thought from Scheler', a single paragraph recounting some actions undertaken by the characters Donald and Frank; while this is less obviously an example of *hors-texte*, it may nevertheless be what Prynne is referring to. Alternatively, Prynne's pre-publication copy of the novel may have differed significantly from both of the published versions.] Yet even this structure is, finally, undermined by Prynne, who acknowledges that 'of course that would just ("just") be a French roman. What you have done is quite beyond that in saturnine tenderness, a novel deeply curled in around the experience of good.'

![The structure of *The Harmless Building*](../PNG/the_harmless_building.png)

Prynne's comments on Oliver's work, along with the negative terms against which he defines its aesthetic achievement, helpfully illuminate his intellectual relationship with Lewis. Literary history is never a zero-sum game; nevertheless, Prynne's selection of Lewis as his favoured 'man of 1914' is bound to have negative as well as positive implications, the more so given the note of conspiracy with which it is made: if Lewis has been unfairly neglected, who has been stealing the limelight? The obvious culprit is James Joyce. In many ways, Prynne's praise of *The Harmless Building* corresponds in an inverted fashion to Lewis's attempted demolition of Joyce---his sometime friend but long-term artistic rival---in the 1926 essay 'The Revolutionary Simpleton', later reprinted as part of *Time and Western Man* (1927). Lewis uses Joyce as an exemplar in fiction of the 'time-cult' which it is the main purpose of *Time and Western Man* to counter, and deploys a wide and sometimes contradictory range of arguments to make his point. He begins with a straightforward denial of Joyce's intellectual capacity, presenting him as an unwitting vehicle for the 'time-machinery' derived from Bergson: 'there is not very much reflection going on at any time inside the head of Mr. James Joyce. That is indeed the characteristic condition of *the craftsman*, pure and simple. [... H]e is not so much an inventive intelligence as an executant.'^[Lewis, *Time and Western Man*, ed. by Paul Edwards (Santa Rosa, CA: Black Sparrow Press, 1993), p. 88.] Joyce's work, for Lewis, is fatally concerned with style---an odd contention for a writer whose own fiction is now primarily read for its stylistic innovations, but one which Lewis pursues doggedly.^[The traces of this contradiction can be felt throughout the essay. At one point, having thoroughly criticised *Ulysses*, Lewis speculates that '*The Enemy of the Stars*, a play written and published by me in 1914, obliterated by the War, turned up [...] in Zurich, and was responsible here and there for the manner of Joyce's book' (*ibid*., p. 107).] Joyce might indeed be described as the exemplar *par excellence* of what Prynne disparages as 'micro-rhetoric': a concern for language's musicality over its meaning. On a more fundamental level, Joyce's work---and particularly *Ulysses*---is criticised for its reliance on time as a structuring principle, as against Lewis's preferred metaphor, space. In a 1963 letter to Olson, Prynne shows his clear appreciation for this attitude, quoting at length from *Time and Western Man* and linking its prescriptions to Ezra Pound's approach in the *Cantos*. Prynne refers specifically to 'Bergson's musicalised world', describing the process of successful poetic creation as a deliberate neutralisation of time: 'time is a governing absolute within the process, the immersal in the poem and its coming to be; but the achieved kinetics of the thing on the page are tensions, which is the idiom of poem as construct or diagram rather than passage or transit.'^[Prynne to Olson, 3 February 1963. According to Ralph Maud, 'Olson liked to tell of Ezra Pound's returning to Joyce his presentation copy of *Finnegan's Wake* with the word "Decadence" written over the cover' (Ralph Maud, *Charles Olson's Reading: A Biography* [Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1996], p. 12), an anecdote which Prynne has also been known to tell. While consistent with his pre-war persona, the fascist Pound's denunciation of artistic 'decadence' in the late 1930s has troubling resonances with the Nazi campaign against '*entartete Kunst*' in the same period.] Assuming something similar may be said to operate in the composition of novels, Prynne's description of *The Harmless Building* as a '3-space' becomes clearer: while this structure includes time as one of its axes, it is a time which has become essentially spatialised, made into just one part of a broader system which is susceptible to diagrammatic representation.^[A similar conception of Pound's poetry as spatial rather than temporal is offered in the conclusion to Chapter VI of Davie's 1964 study, which is based explicitly on 'conversations with J.H. Prynne' (Davie, *Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor*, p. vi). Davie describes Pound's *Cathay* and his later translations of Cavalcanti as 'a static poetry; its constituent parts seem to be almost as much components of an arrangement in space, as phases of a process through time. [... O]f the lines in ['South-Folk in Cold Country'] it seems more accurate to say that they are placed one beneath another, than to say that one comes after another' (p. 118).]

For Lewis, visual art was to be a key model for literature's adoption of space. While Prynne does not compare Oliver's work directly to painting or sculpture, his use of 'water-colour' as a dismissive epithet suggests a similar attitude, watercolour painting being in the popular imagination a weak or feminine version of the 'real thing'.^[A 2011 exhibition of watercolours at the Tate Britain gallery was advertised with the slogan: 'Tate Britain [i]nvites you to challenge your preconceptions of what watercolour is' ('Watercolour', *Tate*, \<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/watercolour\> [accessed 2 November 2014].] This structure helps to clarify what Prynne means by 'pre-sexual', which when applied to poets of the New York School, as above, effectively decodes as 'homosexual'. Pre-sexuality for Prynne is less a necessary developmental stage than a deliberate and contemptible immaturity, standing in the same relation to 'real', mature, procreative sex as a Victorian watercolour does to a vorticist canvas by Lewis. Rather than being a total absence of sex, it is something more like a perversion. Lewis's analysis of *Ulysses*'s supposed obscenity can be seen to run along remarkably similar lines. Discussing the progress of modernity in general, Lewis claims that an increasingly direct cultural emphasis on sex is paradoxically part of a project 'to turn people's minds away from sex altogether eventually.' The one aspect of life in which 'the otherwise popular notion of specialization of function' is taboo, sex is doomed to irrelevance: 'Its expensive ecstasies and personal adornments must go in the end. The supposed encouragement of them today is illusory.' Lewis uses a glancing reference to Henry Havelock Ellis and the evidentially dubious assertion that '[t]he more clothes people have, and the colder the climate, the more "immoral" they become' to prop up a claim in the opposite direction: 'attracted by the lure of the "immoral," everybody in the end will be induced to become more moral, simply-clothed, well-behaved and inexpensive.'^[Lewis, *Time and Western Man*, p. 79.] *Ulysses* is no more than a pawn in this drive towards titillation and illusory immorality: 'Once you admit the licence that, at the start, Joyce set out to profit by, it is surprising how very little "sex" matter there is in his pages.' Importantly, Lewis connects the book implicitly both to homosexuality and to immaturity by invoking the public school: 'What is there is largely either freudian [*sic*] echoes (they had to enter into it), or else it is horse-play of a schoolboy or public-house order.'^[*Ibid*., p. 92.] Like John Ashbery or his English followers, Joyce's concern with sexuality is essentially silly, and certainly not worth serious critical attention (aside, of course, from Lewis's own).

Lewis is not the only literary-philosophical reference point used to describe Oliver's work. Oliver's achievement in *The Harmless Building* is, according to Prynne, to combine the technical sophistication of French theory with something profoundly other: 'The trust usually asked of us [in reading] is textual, or "human" like a friendly dog. But both together is so absolutely delicate and fine, I cannot say how deeply affected I am by having read this book.' He attempts to explain what he means through a passing reference to Iris Murdoch: 'it is the risk throughout which I find profoundly moving. Going right through to where the heart would be if the reader could afford that golden idea-rhyme; I think of Iris Murdoch's paper on "The Idea of Perfection" in her new book *The Sovereignty of Good*.' In this paper, first published in *The Yale Review* in 1964, Murdoch attempts to counter a 'behaviourist, existential, and utilitarian' model of ethics which she considers to be pervasive in British philosophy departments, and whose influence she attributes to G.E. Moore, though her immediate target is her former Oxford colleague Stuart Hampshire.^[Iris Murdoch, 'The Idea of Perfection', *Yale Review*, 53.3 (Spring 1964), 342--80 (p. 348).] Central to this attitude is the idea that we relate to the good not primarily through a process analogous to seeing (introspectively or otherwise) but through actions in the world. Allied to this is the rule that 'mental concepts must be analyzed genetically'---through back-reference from the actions that they occasion---'and so the inner must be thought of as parasitic on the outer.'^[*Ibid*., p. 349.] Applying this rule rigorously leads to a situation in which the concept of a private decision either ceases to be relevant or ceases to exist altogether:

> A decision does not turn out to be [...] an introspectible moment. The concept has no further inner structure; it *is* its outer structure. [...] Of course a sense can be attached to: he decided to but did not. That is: he said he would go, and we had reasons to believe that he would, but a brick fell on his head. Or, the notion of his going cohered with many other things he was doing and saying, and yet he did not go. But all this is just as overt, just as little private, as the actual carrying out of the decision.^[*Ibid*., pp. 352--53.]

Murdoch counters this focus on action by means of an example. M, a mother, dislikes D, her daughter-in-law. M nevertheless behaves perfectly, not allowing her feelings to show, and D subsequently disappears from the scene, either emigrating or dying. M continues to think about D and gradually changes her opinion: 'D is discovered to be not vulgar but refreshingly simple, not undignified but spontaneous, not noisy but gay, not tiresomely juvenile but delightfully youthful, and so on.'^[*Ibid*., p. 356.] No subsequent action on M's part results from this changed opinion. From the behaviourist-existentialist-utilitarian standpoint, this state of affairs can only have meaning in a hypothetical sense: 'M's vision of D has altered *means* that *if* M were to speak her mind about D now she would say different things from the things she would have said three years ago.'^[*Ibid*., p. 358.] But, as Murdoch points out, '[t]he truth of the hypothetical proposition could be consistent with nothing in the interim having occurred in M's mind at all. And of course a change of mind often does take the form of the simple announcement of a new view without any introspectible material having intervened.'^[*Ibid*.] Murdoch spends the remainder of the paper in an attempt to rehabilitate metaphors of vision---and particularly of attention, a concept which she takes from Simone Weil---in moral discourse: 'What M is *ex hypothesi* attempting to do is not just to see D accurately but to see her justly or lovingly. [...] Freedom is not the sudden jumping of the isolated will in and out of an impersonal logical complex, it is a function of the progressive attempt to see the object clearly.'^[*Ibid*., p. 361.] Crucially, she goes on to connect this ethical stance, in which attention is compelled by 'a kind of "necessity"' in the object, to an aesthetic one: 'This is something of which saints speak and which any artist will readily understand. The idea of a patient, loving regard, directed upon a person, a thing, a situation, presents the will not as unimpeded movement but as something very much more like "obedience."'^[*Ibid*., p. 376. Murdoch describes the notion of art 'for its own sake' as 'the familiar Kantian-Bloomsbury slogan', recalling Leavis and Prynne's shared antipathy towards the Bloomsbury Group, and perhaps revealing a cultural or a social as well as a theoretical motive behind her implicit critique of G.E. Moore (p. 377).]

Returning to Prynne's comments on *The Harmless Building*, it is now possible to interpret his statement about 'the risk throughout [... g]oing right through to where the heart would be if the reader could afford that golden idea-rhyme'. For Murdoch, attention to an object is analogous to---or a superset of---loving a person. Prynne has already made clear that he interprets *The Harmless Building* not only as a novel about bodies, but as in some sense a body itself, held together by an endocrine system. It is only logical that such a body would have a heart, the organ responsible for circulating that system's hormones, even if only as an 'idea-rhyme'. While the casual reader may not always be able to 'afford' the level of attention that this model implies, it is nevertheless real, and is a result of what Murdoch would call Oliver's 'patient, loving regard' for the aesthetic object. This object can be read, through the novel's first chapter and its dedication ('For Tom') as a baby: 'I should love to keep a mongol baby alive in my mind, an outgoingness and kindness, a lack of coherence, an area of almost no-harm like a clearing in the middle of harm.'^[Oliver, *The Harmless Building*, p. 5; *Three Variations,* p. 113.] Yet it can just as easily be interpreted as a sexual partner, a reading seemingly encouraged by Chapter 15: 'I'm talking to you. You were Rosine all along; you knew that. I love you.'^[*Ibid*., p. 254.] In fact, it is not necessary to specify a single object, providing that Oliver relates to the novel's series of objects in the mode of 'necessity' and 'obedience' specified by Murdoch. 'Attention worked out so closely does not often attain to a condition of truth', writes Prynne, implying that, in this case at least, it does.^[The connection of this vague aesthetico-ethical attitude to politics is made clearer in a 1986 letter to Oliver: 'I do not believe in a political centre which is any more than the adroit hedging & edging of a party system; but I would separate this from what it claims to imitate, which is the central ordinariness of ethical intuition and human tolerance, even of moral *habit*, in a populace not brutalised by tyranny or privation nor hypnotised into disclaiming its own sentimental loyalties' (Prynne to Oliver, 16 February 1986).]


## iv. Edward Upward

In his remarks to Douglas Oliver, just as in his comments to Peter Riley on Wyndham Lewis, Prynne makes use of age and sexual maturity as tools to distinguish avant-garde English writing from its French and American equivalents. Whether describing the latter as 'adolescent' and 'pre-sexual' or as an 'old-fashioned' art practised by 'old grannies', the implication is that its English counterpart is in the prime of life, dealing with subjects which are appropriate to a mature tradition in forms which are equally appropriate. This chapter will now move to consider a more controversial case, which will test the explanatory value of this structure. Writing to Ed Dorn on 9 September 1975, Edward Upward's 72nd birthday, Prynne introduces the American poet to the work of his British namesake:

> I've just been reading Edward Upward's *The Rotten Elements* (first out in 1969, now in Penguin), which might have frightened me if I hadn't just before that finished off a Project of my own. Upward was the vanished intelligence behind the Auden-Isherwood group; his disgust with the opportunistic pragmatism of English communist party policy seems to me very strikingly clear-minded.^[Prynne to Dorn, 9 September 1975. The potential fear to which Prynne refers may relate to a creative crisis and mental breakdown experienced by Upward's protagonist in *The Rotten Elements*, though this would be obscure to Dorn. The 'project' is also ambiguous, but is probably Prynne's most recent poetic publication, *High Pink on Chrome* (1975).]

This is a relatively conventional description of Upward's position in British literary culture in the mid-1970s.^[The assessment conforms, for instance, to that given by Anthony Arblaster in a 1978 conference paper (Anthony Arblaster, 'Edward Upward and the Novel of Politics' [1978], *Edward Upward*, \<http://www.edwardupward.info/pdfs/Arblaster.pdf\> [accessed 5 May 2015]).] Like Wyndham Lewis, little more than two decades his senior, Upward has been overshadowed by more famous friends and associates, most notably his close friend at school and university, Christopher Isherwood. This neglect is generally attributed to a long period of literary silence coinciding with his membership of the British Communist Party: Upward published no major work between the Second World War and the early 1960s, when *In the Thirties* (1962), the first volume of the trilogy which includes *The Rotten Elements*, was printed.^[The view of Upward as a quintessentially 'thirties' figure was apparently shared by Donald Davie, who sent the older writer a typescript copy of his 1953 poem 'Remembering the Thirties'. Whether Davie knew Upward personally is not clear, but there is at least one other point of personal connection with Prynne, via A.C. Spearing, who was a pupil of Upward's at Alleyn's School and a contemporary of Prynne's both as an undergraduate at Jesus College and as a fellow at Caius. Writing to Upward in 1959, Spearing described his appointment at the latter, noting that 'my new college, which has never in the past encouraged the study of English, has had a change of heart (or at least a change of Master), and wants to build up its English side in future. The new Master is Professor Mott, who is a physicist but sees himself as a sort of Renaissance all-rounder, and he's had a new Director of Studies in English appointed (Donald Davie, whom you may have heard of as a poet and as the author of *Purity of Diction in English Verse* and *Articulate Energy*), with me to assist him' (A.C. Spearing to Upward, 14 July 1959).] Shoring up this characterisation, the semi-autobiographical trilogy---published in full as *The Spiral Ascent* in 1977---takes the conflict between its protagonist's political commitments and his literary ambitions as its central theme.

*In the Thirties* describes how a young, middle-class teacher and poet, Alan Sebrill, joins the Party after a period of creative despair. Sebrill struggles at length to reconcile the three competing demands of political work, 'the poetic life' and his day job, while becoming increasingly disenchanted with what he sees as a drift away from orthodox Leninism by the Party leadership following the war. His attempts to counter this tendency lead to his expulsion, along with his wife, an event which forms the pivotal moment of *The Rotten Elements*.^[New light was shed on this particular volume of the trilogy in 2014 with the release of Upward's personal MI5 file, the contents of which are described in Louis Goddard, 'Not spooked', *Times Literary Supplement* (11 December 2015), p. 17.] In the final volume, *No Home But the Struggle*, a retired Sebrill reflects simultaneously on his childhood and on his current involvement with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Towards the end of the novel, he finally reaches a state of reconciliation between poetry and politics, and the book ends with Upward's stand-in having completed his own great work, 'the poem which I have been working on for six years and have written the final lines of today'.^[Upward, *No Home But the Struggle*, ed. by David Allinson, *Edward Upward*, \<http://www.edwardupward.info/pdfs/No\_Home\_But\_the\_Struggle.pdf\> [accessed 5 May 2015], p. 275.] Describing *The Rotten Elements*, Prynne once again makes use of the term 'pre-sexual': 'I'm glad I can see well past [Upward's] political dilemma for the poet, but I'm glad I can see what the dilemma is, without the paranoid pre-sexual infantilism which was the hall-mark of the late 1960's (itself a legacy of naively self-defensive mythologies from the past).' There are two possible meanings here, generated by the ambiguity of the clause beginning 'without': either Upward's novel is an example of the 'paranoid pre-sexual infantilism' that Prynne describes, but the younger writer is able to 'see past' it; or, he is enabled to 'see past' it precisely because Upward's novel dispenses with it. Prynne's description of the tendency as the 'the hall-mark of the late 1960's', along with the novel's publication date of 1969, would seem to lend weight to the former reading, but his positive assessment of *The Rotten Elements* in the preceding sentence casts doubt on this interpretation. Indeed, the book certainly does not conform to the rough equation of 'pre-sexual' with sexual frivolity outlined in relation to Joyce and the New York School above. The closest approach to these issues in *The Rotten Elements* is a post-coital conversation between Alan Sebrill and his wife, Elsie, concerning the relation between their political and sexual commitments, conducted in Upward's characteristically stilted dialogue. Here, Sebrill's 'hankering after' something other than monogamy is strictly and consensually subordinated to politics:

> 'How wrong the romantics were in their idea that for every person there exists somewhere a unique soul-mate.'  
  'Yes, and in practice it's an idea that doesn’t go at all well with monogamy.'  
  'Perhaps under full communism there will be a return to group marriage. Engels seems almost to favour that.'  
  'I suspect it rather appeals to you too.'  
  'I confess I do have a sentimental hankering after it, because it would be so much fairer to everyone, especially to the less attractive ones. And it might bring back a kind of matriarchy on a higher level, which would compensate women for their biological disadvantages.'  
  'You always were a loyal feminist, dear.'  
  'But at present monogamy seems best.' He put his arm gently around her. She said: 'To be perpetually looking for new sex-partners must be such a drain on energy when there’s so much else to do.'^[Upward, *The Rotten Elements*, ed. by David Allinson, *Edward Upward*, \<http://www.edwardupward.info/pdfs/The\_Rotten\_Elements.pdf\> [accessed 27 November 2015], p. 53.]

The presiding tone here is one of seemingly justified scepticism about the role of sexual experimentation in revolutionary practice---while it may have its place in a communist future, Alan and Elsie seem to agree, it is not properly part of the preparations for that future. While desire is sensibly acknowledged in the form of Sebrill's 'sentimental hankering', it is quickly repressed, not (supposedly) by bourgeois sexual morality, but by reason: even the utopian description of sexual relations under 'full communism' is conducted in logical terms, its arrangement justified as a system of eminently sensible 'compensations'. This acceptance of reproductive monogamy through a sort of sexual pragmatism conforms almost exactly to Prynne's concern for the adult and mature, as opposed to the nympholeptic and pre-sexual, that has already been described.^[*No Home But the Struggle*, first published as part of *The Spiral Ascent* in 1977, contains a much broader range of sexual material than either of the previous two books, including the account of a young Sebrill's relationship with a fellow schoolboy.]

One month prior to the letter to Dorn mentioned above, Prynne sent a copy of Upward's short story 'Sunday' to Barry MacSweeney, along with a single sheet of paper reading '[w]ith the ivory tower keeper's compliments'.^[Prynne to Barry MacSweeney, 7 August 1975.] Written as far back as 1931, this story was first published in Michael Roberts's celebrated *New Country* anthology in 1933; in Upward's own words, it follows 'an office-worker who dreads returning to work on Monday. His thoughts begin on a neurotic and self-centred note, and end with his decision to contact the workers' movement, in other words, the local Communist Party, and to devote himself to a cause outside himself.'^[Upward, 'Statement for the Literature/Sociology Conference on "1936" at Essex University, July 1978', *Edward Upward*, \<http://www.edwardupward.info/pdfs/Statement.pdf\> [accessed 5 May 2015], p. 7.] The publication history, however, is more relevant than the story's content. Having appeared in Roberts's anthology, it was not printed again until 1969, when Heinemann published *The Railway Accident and Other Stories*, a retrospective of Upward's early work intended to accompany *The Rotten Elements*; both volumes were reissued as Penguin paperbacks in 1972. Given the proximity of Prynne's two letters, it seems likely that he read both *The Rotten Elements* and *The Railway Accident* at roughly the same time, a few years after his comments on *The Harmless Building*. (That Prynne was still heavily invested in Oliver's work by this point is confirmed by correspondence throughout 1974, as well as by a mention of Oliver directly after the passage on Upward in his letter to Dorn.^['Doug Oliver was over here a short while ago and is in extreem good form, wary as ever and mucho quick off the mark. He's to be lecturing at Wivenhoe from this October, which is likely to be Off the Map for quite a few, I should think. Did his fight reports reach you OK?' (Prynne to Dorn, 9 September 1975).]) Any similarities between the two writers will therefore be of particular significance, especially in light of the terminological recurrence considered above. In fact, there is a very specific similarity---in all probability an instance of direct influence---between the titular story of Upward's 1969 collection and *The Harmless Building*.

As undergraduates at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Upward and Isherwood collaborated in the creation of a complex and largely private fantasy world. Stemming from a series of in-jokes about shared acquaintances and the university environment, this project---described by Katherine Bucknell as 'an elaborate imaginative game'---eventually took shape as a fictional village, Mortmere, peopled by a shifting cast of variously sinister and bizarre characters.^[Katherine Bucknell, 'Introduction', in Christopher Isherwood and Upward, *The Mortmere Stories* (London: Enitharmon Press, 1994), 9--21 (p. 9). Detailed, if semi-fictional, accounts of Mortmere are provided in *No Home But the Struggle* and in Isherwood's *Lions and Shadows* (London: The Hogarth Press, 1938).] 'The Railway Accident' is the most accomplished story to emerge from this long-running 'game'; as Isherwood describes it in an introduction printed in *New Directions* 11, 'it is the last and longest of the Mortmere stories---a farewell to Mortmere, which left Chalmers [Upward's pseudonym] free to develop his extraordinary technique in other, more fruitful directions.'^[Isherwood, [foreword to 'The Railway Accident'], in Upward, *The Railway Accident and Other Stories* (London: Penguin, 1972), 33--35 (pp. 33--34).] The story is narrated in a highly metaphorical, almost surrealist fashion, which contrasts sharply with the austere prose of Upward's later work. A journey to Mortmere by train is interrupted by the accident of the title; having survived, the two principal characters are ferried by car to a party at Mortmere rectory, where recriminations over responsibility for the crash result in a duel. It is the accident itself which seems to be mirrored as one of the centrepieces of Oliver's *The Harmless Building*. The paragraphs which describe the exact moments of the respective accidents are quoted sequentially below, Oliver following Upward:

> An iron echo approached us. Clambering the lower rocks I turned. The express had taken the points. Booster-fitted, excessively rolling, the racing Mogul engine rounded the curve, bounded into the rear of the carriage we had left. Coaches mounted like viciously copulating bulls, telescoped like ventilator hatches. Nostril gaps in a tunnel clogged with wreckage instantly flamed. A faint jet of blood sprayed from a vacant window. Frog-sprawling bodies fumed in blazing reeds. The architrave of the tunnel crested with daffodils fell compact as hinged scenery. Tall rag-feathered birds with corrugated red wattles limped from holes among the rocks.^[Upward, 'The Railway Accident', in *The Railway Accident*, 33--84 (pp. 61--62).]

> Everyone got out, never minding the bad weather that met them, more concerned that the whole rear of the train had reprehensibly failed in its direction. Donald soon realized that his journey had simply crocked its elbow. He could dimly see the tragedy like a hill in his past. The two central carriages had remarkably telescoped, a time-juncture; they had torn each other's metal aside in eagerness to come together and had reared up in excitement. The engine, quite unharmed, remained coupled on to the front carriage and was panting like a dog no longer interested in the night's orgy. Donald's famous locust gesture came upon him again, cracking his joints, which exuded darkness as the carriages cocked up and uttered that portentous wailing.^[Oliver, *The Harmless Building*, pp. 46--47; *Three Variations*, p. 155.]

Perhaps the most obvious points of comparison here are the twin sexual metaphors, both expressed through reference to animals: where Upward's carriages are 'viciously copulating bulls', Oliver's engine is a sexually sated dog. Two writers recounting similar events might be expected to hit upon similar metaphors, yet Oliver and Upward also deploy identical terminology: both, for instance, describe how the carriages 'telescoped' on impact.

The relative frequency of rail accidents in Britain over the course of the 20th century means that any claim of direct literary influence will have to vie with that of the real world.^[While there is no obvious single incident which might have inspired Oliver, a tempting candidate for Upward's accident is the 27 June 1928 Darlington rail crash, in which 25 people were killed and a further 45 seriously injured following a head-on collision between two trains. '[T]he railway disaster in Durham' is mentioned in a piece of 'automatic writing' supposedly produced by Isherwood while he and Upward stayed on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1928, the same year that Upward is known to have written 'The Railway Accident' (Isherwood, *Lions and Shadows* [London: Methuen, 1953], p. 277; Alan Walker, *Edward Upward: A Bibliography* (London: Enitharmon Press, 2000), p. 96). Against this view is Isherwood's contention that Upward wrote the story during 'the spring term [while] tutoring a boy in the North of England' (Isherwood, *Lions and Shadows*, p. 273), which is backed up (correcting northern England to Scotland) by a manuscript biographical statement included among Upward's papers: 'from February to April [1928] I had a teaching job at Lockerbie in Scotland (here I wrote the Railway Accident [...])' (Upward, biographical statement).] Nevertheless, there is a broader similarity between Upward's early work and *The Harmless Building*, which---when combined with the 1969 publication date of *The Railway Accident and Other Stories*---makes a direct connection more likely. On the most basic level, Upward and Oliver share an interest in provincial, and particularly coastal, English settings. Much of *The Harmless Building* is set in 'a town on the south coast of England', while Mortmere borders the Atlantic Ocean and Upward's later work maintains a fixation on the Isle of Wight.^[Oliver, *Three Variations*, p. 115.] More important, however, are the stylistic affinities between the two authors. As mentioned above, Mortmere is an environment constructed primarily from the eccentricities of its characters, 'all dream-distortions of classic English types', whose slight deviations from expected behaviour set up much of the village's uncanny atmosphere.^[Isherwood, [foreword to 'The Railway Accident'], p. 34.] The same can be said of the nightmarish figures who *The Harmless Building*'s main characters---Donald, Frank and Rosine---meet in the course of the novel's increasingly disturbing plot: principally McFarlane, the inappropriately upbeat and unharmed train driver; his daughter, Mary; and Jerry, Margaret and the 'new man', with whom Donald ends up working at the Tacuarembo Hotel. Indeed, the hotel acts as a sort of micro-Mortmere, a surreal and claustrophobic container for major aspects of the novel's plot. Finally, Upward's Mortmere stories evince the same sort of preoccupation with the human body that can be found in Oliver's novel. The comparison of a railway tunnel to a nostril in the passage from 'The Railway Accident' quoted above is far from being the only point at which the body is projected into the story's surrounding environment; in one memorable example, which might prove useful to a study of the latent misogyny in some of Upward's work, a series of gasometers are compared to the 'stumps of semi-amputated breasts'.^[Upward, 'The Railway Accident', p. 40.] Sex *per se* enjoys a liminal status in Mortmere, and is invariably deviant: the initial draft of 'The Railway Accident' contained a scene involving the rape of a choirboy, but was expurgated prior to publication.^[Mario Faraone, '"Chambers of Oblivion": I Treni di Edward Upward tra Allucinazione, Storia e Memoria', in *Scorci Improvvisi di Altri Orizzonti*, ed. by Faraone, Martina Bertazzon, Giovanna Manzato and Roberta Tommasi (Morrisville, NC: Lulu, 2008), 215--34 (p. 233).]

If *The Harmless Building* and 'The Railway Accident' can be said to resemble each other, both on the level of content and stylistically, it is also possible to make a further comparison. The intensely metaphorical style of Lewis's *Tarr*---which Fredric Jameson identifies more precisely as a self-referential slippage between metaphor and metonymy---was described above, as was its reliance on bizarre, 'cardboard' characters, both features deployed by Oliver and Upward.^[Jameson, pp. 28--29.] However, there are other works in Lewis's *oeuvre* which track even more closely to this vein. Chief among these is *The Wild Body*, a collection of short stories which was first published by Chatto & Windus in 1927, though it was nearing its final form as early as 1919.^[Michael Beatty, 'The Earliest Fiction of Wyndham Lewis and *The Wild Body*', *Theoria*, 48 (May 1977), 37--45 (p. 37).] Prynne mentions the collection in a September 1967 letter to Riley, claiming that it is 'better than' Lewis's more famous novel *The Revenge for Love* (1937), without providing further details.^[Prynne to Riley, 13 September 1967.] The themes and techniques of the stories in *The Wild Body* are helpfully set out by Lewis himself in two explanatory pieces printed towards the end of the volume; importantly for the argument of this chapter, he deals directly with the book's title. Lewis's key aim, it seems, is to defamiliarize the body, demonstrating the various ways in which his characters interact with and interpenetrate their environment, rarely from a conventional perspective of unilateral, authoritative will. In the first of his explanatory pieces, 'Inferior Religions', Lewis reverses conventional conceptions of human agency, describing his characters as 'creaking men machines', which are 'worked' by 'some little restaurant or fishing-boat' (the stories are set primarily in rural Brittany and Spain).^[Lewis, 'Inferior Religions', in *The Wild Body: 'A Soldier of Humour' and Other Stories* (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1928), 233--43 (p. 233).] Apparently familiar human action is made strange by the revelation of the framework of possibility and repetition in which it takes place: 'The wheel at Carisbrooke imposes a set of movements upon the donkey inside it, in drawing water from the well, that it is easy to grasp. But in the case of a hotel or fishing-boat, for instance, the complexity of the rhythmic scheme is so great that it passes as open and untrammelled life.^[*Ibid*., pp. 233--34.] In the following piece, describing the role of humour in the stories, Lewis quotes William James on the fundamental absurdity of the body: 'One need only shut oneself in a closet and begin to think of the fact of one's being there, of one's queer bodily shape in the darkness (a thing to make children scream at, as Stevenson says), of one's fantastic character and all, to have the wonder steal over the detail as much as over the general fact of being, and to see that it is only familiarity that blunts it.'^[Lewis, 'The Meaning of the Wild Body', in *The Wild Body*, 244--251 (p. 245); William James, *Some Problems of Philosophy: A Beginning of an Introduction to Philosophy* (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1996), p. 39.] The comparison with *The Harmless Building* here is irresistible; just like Lewis, Oliver shows a consistent concern with the defamiliarizing, metaphorical description of the body. To take two examples almost at random: 'her hips fell over to one side, settling over awkward legs like a dollop of icecream lodged in a biased way on a double-barrelled cornet. Only the cornet wasn't straight. Each leg was more like a penknife with one blade open'; 'His body was composed of three rams' heads on a totem pole: 1. his real face; 2. his shoulders and their long face-torso, with nipple eyes and a "these sweets are a bit sour" navel mouth; 3. a dwarf genital face with a long nose.'^[Oliver, *Three Variations*, p. 170; *ibid*., p. 188.]

In accordance with the roughly triangular structure identified in this chapter's introduction, this tendency does not map quite as clearly on to Upward's work, though Upward himself claims that 'a certain inhumaneness in the descriptions of the personal appearances of Mr Parkin and McCreath and others in J. to the B. [*Journey to the Border*] I caught from Lewis.'^[Upward, 'Answers to questions'.] If Oliver is excluded, however, there is a much stronger point of comparison to be found. As with Mortmere, Lewis's stories are fundamentally comic. This is made clear in the two explanatory pieces discussed above, in which Lewis attempts to set out a basic theory of comedy---or, more accurately, laughter. Lewis contends, in line with his comments on 'creaking men machines', that '[t]he root of the Comic is to be sought in the sensations resulting from the observations of a *thing* behaving like a person.'^[Lewis, 'The Meaning of the Wild Body', p. 247.] As such, his characters are 'puppets': 'I would present these puppets, then, as carefully selected specimens of religious fanaticism. With their attendant objects or fetishes they live and have a regular food and vitality. [...] Their mechanism is a logical structure and they are nothing but that.'^[Lewis, 'Inferior Religions', p. 236.] One of the many definitions of laughter given by Lewis is as a 'thunderbolt' accompanying the fleeting recognition of oneself as just such a puppet.^[Lewis, 'The Meaning of the Wild Body', p. 246. Lewis returns in this piece to the issue of national identity, offering a more nuanced perspective than that which is implied in *Tarr*: 'It is easy for us to see, if we are french, that the German is "absurd," or if german, that the French is "ludicrous," for we are *outside* in that case. [...] What it is far more difficult to appreciate, with any constancy, is that, whatever his relative social advantages or particular national virtues may be, every man is profoundly open to the same criticism or ridicule from any opponent who is only different enough' (*ibid*., pp. 245--46).] The characters of Mortmere appear to conform to Lewis's model, their interactions determined by a 'logical structure' composed of diverse 'objects and fetishes'. Upward's and Isherwood's world is distinguished from Lewis's by the tendency, as in a warped detective story, of this logic to be simultaneously overt and subterranean; in other words, for its form to be acknowledged, but for its content to remain mysterious. This is pre-eminently the case in 'The Railway Accident', where the accident itself (in fact a repeat of a previous crash) is foreshadowed very early on in the story, yet none of the characters have conventionally plausible motives for engineering it and responsibility remains ambiguous at the story's conclusion. Nevertheless, the 'thunderbolt' that powers Mortmere is, as in Lewis, the liminal status of the observer, who may at any time realise their complicity in the mad world that they are attempting to describe. As Isherwood notes,

> *The Railway Accident* may [...] be regarded as satire. But it is something more than that; it has an extra-dimension. It is, so to speak, a satire on satire, a parody of parody. Satire requires a norm, a sane observer, a standard of contrast. Where can we find one here? Hearn, the 'I' of the narrative, is just as crazy as the people he describes. Indeed, he may be crazier---for we begin to suspect that this entire journey and its sequel may be taking place only in his own imagination.^[Isherwood, [foreword to 'The Railway Accident'], p. 34.]

Or, in Lewis's more ambiguous definition, '[s]atire is the great Heaven of Ideas, where you meet the titans of red laughter; it is just below intuition, and life charged with black illusion.'^[Lewis, 'Inferior Religions', p. 236.]


## v. The *Plant Time Manifold* Transcripts

In order to more accurately examine how the complex of qualities described above---sexual maturity, the body, satire, Vorticism, anti-French and -American sentiment---fits together into something like a coherent description of Prynne's relation to prose fiction, it will be necessary to consider the one text by Prynne himself which has a reasonable claim to the form. 'The *Plant Time Manifold* Transcripts' was first published in *Grosseteste Review* in 1974; it is thus roughly contemporaneous with the Penguin edition of *The Railway Accident*, *The Harmless Building* and Prynne's letter to Oliver, as well as sharing a publisher with the latter two.^['The "PLANT TIME MANIFOLD" Transcripts', *Grosseteste Review*, 7.1--3 (Summer 1974), pp. 80--88. The text will hereafter be referred to in the singular as 'the *PTM*', in accordance with Justin Katko's usage.] Early ideas for the text had been worked out in a series of letters to Ed Dorn, which appeared in modified form as reports in *Bean News* in 1972.^[Prynne to Dorn, 14 March 1972, published as '& Hoc Genus Omne', *Bean News* (1972), [p. 2]; Prynne to Dorn, 25 March 1972, published as 'Full Tilt Botany: Ideal Weapons for Suicide Pacts', *Bean News* (1972), [p. 8]. A number of less significant *PTM*-related texts are listed in Katko, p. 248, n. 9.] The *PTM* is presented for the most part as an account of a scientific conference on the 'Plant Time Manifold' of its title, which can be roughly summarised as the idea that plants' bi-directional vertical movement (roots downward, shoots upward) implies the need for a new model of time. Held in London and extending from 1 April at the latest to 3 May 1972, the conference is fictional, as are its participants, who are given the names of plants: Professor Lichen, Dr Cypress, Dr Gale. Nevertheless, the academic papers and books to which these characters refer in their reported presentations are invariably real, with scrupulous citations and easily traceable quotes. The *PTM* thus exists in a liminal space between veracious academic discourse and fiction, a characteristic to which we will return below. Whereas Justin Katko, in the most detailed account to date, reads the *PTM* on the most literal level, taking the text as one which 'knows itself to constitute actual scientific thinking', this reading will pay deliberate attention to its fictional aspects, something which scholars of Prynne's work have so far been reluctant to do.^[Katko, p. 252. A comprehensive overview of existing work on the *PTM* is provided in Katko, pp. 250--57.] This is not to contradict Katko's explicit and strongly argued claim that the science of the work should be taken seriously, but it is to temper his subsequent contention that 'any projection of irony or satire onto the core propositions of this treatise would be detrimental to a clear-eyed grasp of the hypothesis'.^[Katko, p. 257.] While we might well agree that any such 'projection' would be unwarranted, it is possible to deny that what other critics have performed is a projection at all. Real science may be embedded within a fictional frame, and the frame itself may be worthy of analysis; but its position as a frame does not separate it irremediably from that which it contains. As Katko points out, referring to one of the original *Bean News* reports which formed the basis of the authoritative text published in *Grosseteste Review*, 'the satirical frame is not locked in until the end of "Full Tilt Botany," where we enter the diegetic framework of the actual *PTM* conference'---in other words, the initial stages of the text are presented more or less transparently as Prynne's own discourse, or at least as that of his pseudonym Erasmus W. Darwin.^[*Ibid*.] Nevertheless, the decision to expand the frame in the compiled version, beginning the text as reportage---'Today's session of the London PTM Conference'---clearly authorises the interpretation of the whole work as fictional, if only as one reading among others.^['The *Plant Time Manifold* Transcripts', in *Poems*, 233--42 (p. 234). The posture of absolute seriousness adopted by Katko is of course scrupulously Prynnian in character. It is the *PTM*'s own anomalousness in Prynne's *oeuvre* which creates the limits against which this approach strains. ]

Perhaps the most obvious sense in which the *PTM* may be compared to the work of Lewis, Oliver and Upward is in its use of humour. However serious its scientific content, the *PTM* is a fundamentally comic text; Drew Milne goes so far as to claim that it 'contains moments of undergraduate knockabout'.^[Drew Milne, 'The Art of Wit and the Cambridge Science Park', in *Contemporary Poetry and Contemporary Science*, ed. by Robert Crawford (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 170--87 (p. 180).] Crucially, the methods through which this humour is generated share much with those of the writers considered above. Prynne's characters, for instance, are completely lacking in depth: like Lewis's Breton peasants in *The Wild Body*, they are 'puppets', shaped by their environment---in this case, the academic conference---rather than shaping it. For the most part, figures like Professor Quondam Lichen are relatively transparent mouthpieces for the monophonic scientific discourse that makes up the bulk of the *PTM*. Rather than being given verbatim, their papers are narrated in the third person by the text's ostensible author, a scientific journalist who, while not strictly extradiegetic, nevertheless refrains from intervening in any of the action. At one important point, however, the characters' speech is reported directly; as this is the most conventionally fictional part of the text, it will be worth considering in detail. The section follows Lichen's initial paper and is presented as a transcript from a seminar attended by Lichen, Cypress and 'a small group of co-workers' following 'a prolonged lunch'.^['The *Plant Time Manifold* Transcripts', p. 235.] Cypress, 'relax[ing] the formalities', asks Lichen a question about 'root uptake of organic compounds in the, er, higher plants', a hierarchical term at which Lichen---not being a 'higher plant' himself---takes offence.^[*Ibid*., p. 236.] Lichen embarks on a long and increasingly ill-tempered rant, with Cypress attempting to intervene, before 'collaps[ing] into a rosette on the desk', having 'during the previous ("convivial") lunch taken in a good deal of liquid refreshment.'^[*Ibid*., p. 237.] Of the texts considered above, the one which this section most closely resembles is Upward's 'The Railway Accident'. Like most of Upward's Mortmere stories, it is dialogue-heavy, involving a rapid back-and-forth between two characters (though unlike parts of 'The Railway Accident', Prynne avoids confusion by repeating the characters' names in the dialogue: 'Well, Dr Cypress'; 'Oh indeed yes, Professor Lichen').^[*Ibid*., p. 236.] The characters themselves, though nominally plants, are recognisably upper-middle class Englishmen of exactly the sort that populate Mortmere, and as in many of the Mortmere stories---though not 'The Railway Accident'---their conversation is given added momentum by the intoxication of the one of the parties. Most importantly, the dialogue follows the characteristically Mortmerian structure according to which a seemingly benign surface narrative conceals an obscure and potentially violent undercurrent; in fact, this is made clear by the narrator, for whom 'the incident [...] remains indicative of important biometric tensions underlying this London conference.'^[*Ibid*., p. 237.]

An even stronger resemblance can be found between this particular section of the *PTM* and a work which falls firmly outside the nexus represented by Lewis, Oliver and Upward, but which forms part of the broader cultural formation analysed in Chapter 1. It would be misleading to characterise the *PTM* solely as academic satire; while the conference setting is important, it remains a frame for the action which takes place within it. Even so, and despite its avant-garde credentials, it seems clear that the *PTM* owes something to the British campus novel, a genre whose two most famous examples---Kingsley Amis's *Lucky Jim* (1954) and David Lodge's *Changing Places* (1975)---sit roughly at either end of this thesis's chronological scope. The most instructive point of comparison is Chapter 22 of Amis's novel, which forms the comic climax of the book. Having repeatedly steadied his nerves with whisky and sherry, the protagonist Jim Dixon---a member of academic staff at a provincial university---gives a public lecture on the topic 'merrie England'. Just as in the *PTM*, the lecture begins relatively normally but quickly degenerates. Where Lichen's descent into drunkenness is signified by orthography ('scr-r-rupulous', 'Hoots mon', 'crowlin' creatures', 'obsairved'), Dixon's is described directly: 'Almost unconsciously he began to adopt an unnameable foreign accent and to read faster and faster, his head spinning. [...] He began punctuating his discourse with smothered snorts of derision. He read on, spitting out the syllables like curses, leaving mispronunciations, omissions, spoonerisms uncorrected'.^[Kingsley Amis, *Lucky Jim* (London: Victor Gollancz, 1957), p. 230. It is an open question whether the use of the archaic 'shew' for 'show' in Lichen's dialogue (*PTM*, p. 236) is intended to contribute to this effect, given Prynne's subsequent use of the term in non-fictional contexts, e.g. 'basic features of morphology and grammar are claimed to shew correlation with features of their regular speech-forms' (Prynne, *Stars, Tigers and the Shape of Words* [London: Birkbeck College, 1993], p. 7). There is a further possibility that Lichen's dialogue is intended to represent a Scottish accent, the character being resident at the 'Edinburgh Institute for Plant History' (*PTM*, p. 234).] Nevertheless, intoxication is in both cases signified by changes in speech. Dixon does not finally collapse like Lichen, but it is made clear that he is not far from it ('He paused and swayed; the heat, the drink, the nervousness, the guilt at last joined forces in him'), and his behaviour is certainly 'indicative of important [...] tensions'---principally his fraught relationship with his senior colleague, Professor Welch, whose voice Dixon accidentally imitates in the course of the lecture.^[Amis, *Lucky Jim*, p. 231. There are, of course, no shortage of novels which satirise the academy. A more avant-garde model for the *PTM* can be found in Samuel Beckett's *Watt* (1953), published one year before *Lucky Jim*; specifically, in the farcical university committee scene that concludes the story of Mr. Louit and Mr. Nackybal. As M. Keith Booker points out, this 'appears to be a cross between Abbott and Costello and academic committees everywhere---with the suggestion that there is not much difference between the two' (M. Keith Booker, *Literature and Domination: Sex, Knowledge, and Power in Modern Fiction* [Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1993], p. 34).]

Before connecting the *PTM* more directly to the work of Oliver and Lewis, it is worth considering the academic aspect of the text in more detail. As noted above, the conference frame is incidental to the thesis that sits at the heart of the text, but it is not therefore arbitrary. Prynne has spent almost his entire literary career in an academic environment---an environment towards which he has entertained considerable ambivalence, as the latter part of Chapter 1 sought to demonstrate. The university and its associated institutions constitute the field of production of virtually all of Prynne's poetry and prose. Why, then, does it take until 1974 for this field to become visible in the work itself? To put it another way, what is it about the precise period in which the *PTM* was composed that allows the academy to cross the gap from context to content? It appears easy to dismiss this question by referring to the *PTM*'s origins in the satirical newspaper *Bean News*, in which Prynne's character Erasmus W. Darwin had already been established as a scholar, if not strictly as an academic.^[Darwin uses a consistently technical vocabulary in his regular 'bulletins', and in 'When is now' appears to have access to data from the fictional 'Cambridge-based Bioparallax Research Station' (*Bean News* [1972], [p. 4]).] Yet all this really serves to do is to the push the question back a couple of years, from the time of the publication of the *PTM* as such in 1974 to the beginning of Prynne's reports for *Bean News* in 1972. An answer seems unlikely to be found at the macro level of UK higher education policy, either: in stark contrast to her period as Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher's 1970--74 tenure as Education Secretary saw British universities remain comparatively untouched---her written statement at the launch of the 1972 Education White Paper spent more space on teacher training than on the entirety of higher education.^[Margaret Thatcher, 'Written Statement launching Education White Paper (*A Framework for Expansion*)' (6 December 1972), *Margaret Thatcher Foundation*, \<http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/102233\> [accessed 7 September 2015].] What, then, of the micro level, that of Prynne's individual career?

In 1972, Prynne became a University Lecturer, having previously only held positions at his own college, Gonville and Caius; writing to Dorn, he emphasised that the role came with 'something close to tenure if I want it'.^[Prynne to Dorn, 10 January 1972.] As might be expected, this appointment seems to have entailed a considerable increase in his professional responsibilities. Writing to Dorn again in 1975, in a notably untidy hand, Prynne gives a powerful account of the stresses of combining academic work with childcare:

> for the last 50 hours I've had no sleep at all. I don't know how I got into this stupid spiral and I must never do it again. But until this bloody term is over I can do *nothing* […]. When*ever* you ring I am working with some eager creep, when I finish it's never before 4 a.m., it's a treadmill […].^[Prynne to Dorn, 5 March 1975.]

Married with two young children and having recently bought a house, it is perhaps not so difficult to see why Prynne would in his mid- to late-30s emphasise maturity as an aesthetic criterion. Importantly, the integration into the structures of bourgeois society represented by these personal milestones comes at the same time as what is arguably Prynne's tightest professional integration into the university. As a student and later as a research fellow at Caius, Prynne's poetic identity threatened to eclipse his academic one: whatever his later assessment of *Force of Circumstance*, to have a debut collection issued by a major national publishing house at the age of 26 is a significant achievement. The same is obviously true of the later stages of Prynne's career, certainly since the publication of the first edition of his collected poems in 1982, in which his increasing literary fame has far outstripped any academic advancement (Prynne has never, for instance, held the title of professor at Cambridge, though his poetic work has led to honorary and visiting professorial appointments at the University of Sussex and at Sun Yat-sen University in China). The 1970s, however, represent a window between these two stages. Not only was Prynne given an official university position in this period, but through Caius he was on close terms with some of the most important academic, and especially scientific, figures of the period: notably Stephen Hawking, whose *Large Scale Structure of Space-Time* was published in 1973, and the Nobel laureate Francis Crick. The biochemist and sinologist Joseph Needham, a close friend of Prynne's, served as Master of the college from 1966--76, affording him further influence. In satirising the politics and personality clashes of contemporary academic science, then, Prynne may well have been drawing on personal experience of a relatively recent character; indeed, it could easily be the case that the *PTM*'s sophisticated engagement with modern biology and physics would not have been possible had it been composed in a less academically diverse environment than a Cambridge college. Some of the specific results of this diversity will be considered in the conclusion to this chapter.

To return to the *PTM*'s fictional qualities, what is it that links the text to the work of Oliver and Lewis, its 'Mortmerian' character having already been considered? The key point of connection, which gives rise to a number of subconnections, is the text's concern with the body. It was argued above that both Lewis and Oliver strive continually to defamiliarize the human body; this is done primarily through the means of metaphor (Lewis's 'creaking men-machines', Oliver's ice cream cornets and penknives), with the body as tenor and some conventionally inanimate object as vehicle. Beyond defamiliarization, the fundamental effect here is to remove the barrier between the body and its other: the body becomes a simple part of the material world, just like anything else. At times, however, this metaphorical structure breaks down into something less rigid. This can be seen clearly in the second quotation from Oliver given above, in which the body is said to resemble 'three rams' heads on a totem-pole'. While this introduction obeys the conventional arrangement of tenor and vehicle, what follows does not, as the body is divided into three faces, comprising the character's actual face, his torso and his genitals. Comparing a face to a face is relatively straightforward, but doing the same with a face and a torso or a face and genitals---separate parts of the same body---is more complex. As a metaphorical operation, it may be considered the reverse of that for which Prynne defended Shelley in his reply to Leavis, though it is by no means less disruptive of conventional sense-making. Rather than forgetting the tenor in a too-eager concern for the properties of the metaphorical vehicle, Oliver sticks rigidly to the former, seeking his vehicle in the tenor itself. This is achieved through successive metonymic expansions (from the torso and genitals to the body as a whole) and contractions (from the body back down to the face). In the case of the torso-face comparison, this operation works along a pre-existing aesthetic path laid down by such works as the paintings in René Magritte's *Le Viol* ('The Rape') series.^[Another Magritte painting, *La Durée poignardée* ('Time Transfixed'), is used on the cover of the 1972 Penguin edition of Upward's *The Railway Accident*.]

The metaphorical implications of the *PTM* with regard to the human body similarly fail to conform to the simple animate/inanimate defamiliarization structure. In Prynne's text, plants take the place of humans, but this is by no means a simple process of substitution. In fact, the *PTM* derives much of its comic force precisely from its failure seamlessly to map tenor on to vehicle, leaving the reader in a sort of no-man's-land between the two. As mentioned above, the most important clue to the text's metaphorical structure is provided by the characters' names: Lichen, Cypress, 'Myrtle' Gale. Yet Prynne allows the reader to take in four lengthy paragraphs of Professor Quondam Lichen's reported paper before his colleague, Cypress, is introduced, making it difficult to pick up on the joke from the very beginning. Moreover, the use of a mixed bag of species (Gale, referring to *Myrica gale*), plant family (Cypress) and organism (Lichen) names in place of personal names creates further confusion: are these characters to be understood as individual plants, or as representatives of their hierarchically distinct botanical categories? Is it significant that the character with the highest academic honours, Lichen, represents the most conceptually broad category, or that the only character definitely identified as a woman represents the narrowest? What is the significance of sexual identification at all---including, in lines such as 'Dr G flashed a sweet smile', what seems like flirting---in relation to organisms which are only rarely dioecious (having separate male and female plants)?^[*PTM*, p. 238.] On a more troubling level, if the characters are to be understood as plants, then are they experimenting on their own kind? or is, for example, Lichen's work on beans intended to mirror human experimentation on other mammals? Is the apparent lack of a clear hierarchical relationship between scientist and subject, lichen and beans, cause for concern, or does it in fact give the lie to human prejudices based on evolutionary complexity?^[The issue of prejudice is of course taken up in the seminar scene, in which Lichen claims that 'there are all too many today who confuse height above ground with innate developmental superiority' (*ibid*., p. 236).] To ask such questions is not to 'over-read' an essentially comic text, but rather to treat the *PTM*'s fictional frame with the same seriousness that critics have used in analysing its scientific content.

To understand whether or not the characters in the *PTM* have bodies in a conventional sense, it is helpful to turn once again to the seminar scene discussed above. Beginning at the conclusion of Lichen's paper, this scene includes the first significant use of verbs to describe characters' actions, the only previous instance being the statement in the introductory paragraph that the paper was 'delivered by Professor Quondam Lichen'.^[*Ibid*., p. 234.] The paper having been delivered, then, Lichen is greeted with 'polite, photosynthetic applause.'^[*Ibid*., p. 235.] Immediately, plant (photosynthesis) and human (applause) are confused, with no guidance given on how to interpret the resulting compound, though the mention of photosynthesis perhaps suggests plants clapping their leaves. The narrator makes reference to a 'prolonged lunch' preceding the seminar, but the characters are never described eating and drinking directly, leaving the exact nature of their physical embodiment mysterious. In the course of Lichen's drunken rant, the pendulum seems to swing from human back to plant action; defending the status of lichens as a class, the professor describes 'seeing trees *held up* by their Lichen canopies', a statement in which the capitalisation of 'lichen' reintroduces the problems of naming which have already been described.^[*Ibid*., p. 236.] Dismissing carrots, he further alleges that 'those crowlin' creatures will metabolise anything, phagocytic riff-raff', a statement which obviously takes its points of reference from the plant kingdom, despite humans also being able to 'metabolise'.^[*Ibid*.] Finally, Lichen's collapse after having 'taken in a good deal of liquid refreshment' is clearly meant to recall alcoholic intoxication, yet the lack of an explicit statement to that effect leaves open the possibility of a more plant-appropriate explanation.^[*Ibid*., p. 237.]

In the course of the *PTM*'s narrative sections, Prynne is clearly concerned to blur the boundary between human and plant, refusing to provide a one-to-one correspondence (if such a thing would even be possible) between the actions of his characters and what they represent. He does not simply 'see men as trees, walking' (Mark 8:24): the plants in Prynne's text think, act and speak like humans, yet what they speak about---phagocytosis, photosynthesis---often reaffirms their status as non-human organisms. As well as mirroring Oliver's metaphorical disruption of the body, this technique functions as a text-wide version of a process conducted in a much more compressed fashion (though with a greater proliferation of metaphorical vehicles) by Lewis. A perfect example is given by Hugh Kenner, a description of the eponymous main character of the story 'Bestre', whose body is in one paragraph compared to a landscape, a cow, some sort of jug or cup, a liquid, genitals, snakes and a pig. 'We all believe [...] in sleek organic integrity when the object of attention is a Man, someone "human" like our fine selves,' writes Kenner.

> But this man is built up of parts, of oddly assorted phrases [...]. When we read 'Bestre', as we must, against something we carry in our heads, the uncodified but substantial tradition of personal description, all that novelists have learned from one another about ways to convey the look of people, then we may suspect a chasm between affrontive reality and literature's suave procedures. Bestre is not so much ushered on to the page, as relentlessly looked at, between discharges of metaphoric shells.^[Hugh Kenner, 'Wyndham Lewis: The Satirist as Barbarian', *The Yearbook of English Studies*, 14 (1984), 264--75 (p. 269).]

The 'tensions underlying this London conference' might, then, be glossed as the natural conflicts which emerge from any attempt by living organisms to adopt an attitude of scientific observation towards life. It is notable that Lichen's seemingly well-intentioned defence of the 'lowly organisms' against Cypress's use of the term 'higher plants' quickly descends into a new form of name-calling; following the attack on carrots, he comes out with the ambiguously patrician/meritocratic statement that 'any natural fool would make a clever fellow, if he was properly brought up', before revealing another prejudice: 'though for them worm-infested tubers it's mostly *down*, unsaturated carbon chains of the most naive kind'.^[*Ibid*., p. 236--37.] If, having followed his argument so far, we bridle at Lichen's denigration of tubers, why should we retain a similarly arbitrary prejudice placing humans in ethical superiority to plants?^[This moment of realisation is akin to whatKenner describes as satire's oscillation between seduction and shock: 'What were we doing, sagely nodding our heads as the Modest Proposer prattled about the sheer nuisance of being assailed by beggars? Is *that* a way to state the Irish problem?' (Kenner, p. 264).] In this sense, the *PTM* uses the metaphorical techniques of literary fiction---techniques similar to those used by Oliver and Lewis---temporarily to tap into a wider constellation of early-'70s concerns, characterised by the emerging environmental movement in general and the controversy around plant sentience in particular.^[Key environmentalist milestones in this period include the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, the US ban on the pesticide DDT in 1972 and the founding of the first national green party, Britain's PEOPLE, in 1973.]

This controversy is epitomised by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird's *The Secret Life of Plants* (1973), which appeared in the year between Prynne's contributions to *Bean News* and the publication of the compiled *PTM*, though excerpts had been included in the November 1972 issue of *Harper's Magazine*.^[Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, 'Love among the cabbages', *Harper's Magazine* (November 1972), pp. 90--92, 94--96.] In this engagingly written but academically questionable work, the authors summarise the alleged findings of a number of independent researchers into plant intelligence, going on to discuss the implications of these results for humanity's interaction with the plant world. Both the researchers quoted and the authors themselves make frequent use of concepts and terminology associated with the New Age movement and other 'alternative philosophies', and Tompkins and Bird take a stance deliberately biased in favour of their subject, though not without the occasional hint of irony. Discussing the work of Clive Backster, for example---a CIA interrogation specialist who used polygraph machines to claim that plants could anticipate human actions---the authors describe how

> plants can quickly become so attuned to human beings that it is not always possible to obtain exactly the same reactions with different experimenters. […] Personal involvement with an experiment, and even prior knowledge of the exact time an event was scheduled, was often enough to 'tip off' a plant into noncooperation.^[Tompkins and Bird, *The Secret Life of Plants* (New York: Harper & Row, 1973), p. 12.]

More interesting than the specific experimental results, or lack thereof, is the general tenor of the book, which in its combination of playful open-mindedness and (nominally) scientific method mirrors Prynne's approach in the *PTM*. It is particularly telling that in the book's introduction Tompkins and Bird raise the exact phenomenon which forms the factual basis for Prynne's plant time hypothesis:

> Poets and philosophers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Rudolf Steiner, who took the trouble to watch plants, discovered that they grow in opposite directions, partly burrowing into the ground as if attracted by gravity, partly shooting up into the air as if pulled by some form of antigravity, or levity.^[*Ibid*., p. x.]

For all Katko's emphasis on the absolute seriousness of the *PTM*, a tension between 'gravity' (the scientific hypothesis) and 'levity' (the comic fictional frame) makes for an apt description of the text itself.

That Prynne, like Oliver, is aware of the specific power wielded by partial or ambiguous metaphors---the comparison between plants and humans in the *PTM* being a paradigmatic example---can be seen by turning to a recent prose work, *Graft and Corruption: Shakespeare's Sonnet 15* (2015), which also happens to deal with the plant kingdom. Despite fitting into the sequence of Prynne's post-2001 commentaries on Shakespeare, Wordsworth and George Herbert---a category which arguably also includes 2014's *Concepts and Conception in Poetry*, a study of Wordsworth and Wallace Stevens---*Graft and Corruption* has origins closer to the period of this thesis, though not strictly within it: according to a note on the text, '[t]his lecture, originally given in the Faculty of English at Cambridge University in around the late 1970s-early 1980s, has been more recently (2015) somewhat extended, though its main arguments have not been altered and its references have not been updated.'^[Prynne, *Graft and Corruption: Shakespeare's Sonnet 15* (Cambridge: Face Press, 2015), p. 52. The latest book cited in the text is Roy Strong's *The Renaissance Garden in England* (1979), which Prynne describes as 'recent'.] Here, Prynne offers an exemplary technical reading of Shakespeare's poem, drawing on extensive research into the early modern understanding of horticultural grafting---the artificial attachment of a fresh shoot or 'scion' from one plant to the 'stock' of another---to provide a new interpretation of the sonnet's final two lines, 'And all in war with Time for loue of you | As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.'^[ William Shakespeare, *Shake-speares Sonnets Neuer before Imprinted* (London, 1609), sig. B~4~^r^, quoted in *ibid*. , p. 12.] Beginning with a discussion of the soul, Prynne notes that 'the apparently generalising usage of "thing" in line one ['When I consider euery thing that growes'] disguis[es] the decisive recognition that, while men and plants are alike technically *things that grow*, the difference is that man's soul traditionally does not grow but is the immortal part immune to physical time.'^[*Ibid*., p. 14.] The grafting operation desired by Shakespeare's speaker is therefore aberrant from what Prynne presents as the conventional Christian perspective, seeking to prolong the life of the body rather than that of the soul. The technicalities of grafting as a process further destabilize the metaphor. As Prynne points out,

> the action of grafting requires three components: the stock or basal part of a plant; the scion or shoot from another and preferred species; and the grafter. The last two need give little trouble, since the grafter is the poet-lover and the scion is the image of the beloved in his youthful beauty and perfection. But what is the stock?^[*Ibid*., p. 39.]

Prynne's candidate is the poem itself, or the sequence of poems which makes up the *Sonnets*. Yet this possibility introduces a tension insofar as a grafting stock has no independent life of its own---once the grafting process is complete, the scion determines almost all future activity. Either the poet's creations are merely supporting structures for their images of the beloved, or the beloved himself is the stock supporting the growth of the poems, a possibility which seems almost sacrilegious in the broader context of the Renaissance sonnet sequence and its ideological underpinnings. Prynne concludes with the suggestion that the flawed and self-contradictory nature of the grafting analogy---earlier, he refuses to describe it as an 'image', 'since the metaphoric device cannot be envisaged in any way literally or as intelligible to the mind's eye'---might be part of a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage, causing the structure of the poem to fail at its apex in order to reveal something more profound about the nature of desire and its (non)fulfilment.^[*Ibid*., pp. 38--39.] Is it possible, he asks, 'that the image will not work quite seriously enough to be taken seriously; and deliberately thus, as to take it with full seriousness would be to discover that it could not work at all?'^[*Ibid*., p. 49.]

How, then, does Prynne's argument in *Graft and Corruption* relate to the subjects which were identified at the beginning of this section, principally sexual maturity and the body? It will be recalled that Prynne uses youth and maturity as oppositional terms in his discussion of writers such as Lewis and Oliver, painting American poets as 'art-gallery nympholepts' concerned only with a 'pre-sexual phenomenology' that is essentially, and unfortunately, French. This national coding ties into a broader structure counterposing solid, serious work and frivolous artificiality, which can be detected as the basis of many comments in Prynne's letters in this period; writing to the American poet Robin Blaser in 1973, for instance, with a stinging critique of his work, Prynne refers to 'the fashionable French intellectual, more than content with the sawdust of rhetoric in place of the true honie & gall on the lips of the poet'---a poet who, as the archaic orthography of the proverbial 'honey and gall' suggests, is English by default.^[Prynne to Robin Blaser, 28 August 1973.] There seems at first glance to be a ready-made counterpart to this structure in the opposition between natural growth and grafting. Natural growth shares all the qualities implicitly promoted by Prynne: it is the product of sexual reproduction among mature plants whose physical proximity ensures a certain level of indigeneity. Grafting, by contrast, involves the eminently artificial importation of 'foreign' shoots (within certain genetic limits) with the explicit purpose of rendering sexual reproduction unnecessary. Thus, while grafted plants are not strictly 'pre-sexual' in the sense that they are unable to reproduce, what they exhibit is a sort of fast-tracked or counterfeit maturity; moreover, if a process of continual regrafting such as that seemingly described in Sonnet 15 takes place, then they will not even need to sexually reproduce themselves. The connection is more than conceptual: at one point in the text, Prynne notes that '[i]n earlier literary usage, often allegorical, the characteristic term for scion is *ympe*', a word with a pleasing similarity, if not a direct etymological connection, to *nymph*.^[Prynne, *Graft and Corruption*, p. 31. For demonstrations of Prynne's aversion to the restrictions of conventional etymology, see 'A Pedantic Note in Two Parts', *Stars, Tigers and the Shape of Words* and *Mental Ears and Poetic Work*, *passim*.]

Prynne's argument in *Graft and Corruption* is, however, too subtle to conform to the strict correspondence described above. Having raised the issue of grafting's supposed artificiality and circumvention of nature, he refuses to accept this easy characterisation, instead embarking on a lengthy discussion of the concept of artificiality itself. Prynne first quotes Polixenes in *The Winter's Tale*, who uses a grafting analogy to provide the 'traditional defence' of artifice:

> we marry  
A gentler Sien, to the wildest Stocke,  
And make conceyue a barke of baser kinde  
By bud of Nobler race. This is an Art  
Which do's mend Nature: change it rather, but  
The Art it selfe, is Nature.^[Shakespeare, *The Winter's Tale* (Folio, 1623), IV.iv.89--97 (sig. Bb~2~^v^), quoted in Prynne, *Graft and Corruption*, p. 34.]

The supposedly persuasive appeal to tradition in this argument in fact renders it unconvincing, not least to its intended fictional recipient, Perdita, who as Prynne notes 'finds it to be freakish and contaminated [and] refuses to accept the act of grafting as safely within the permitted and natural order of things.'^[*Ibid*., pp. 35--38.] There is, however, a further level to Prynne's discussion. Through a consideration of the gradual accretion of pejorative connotations around the word 'conceit', Prynne reveals the complex and multiple layers of artificiality which make up such tropes: 'grafting was recognised as a curious, subtle and conceited action […]; in figurative contexts this element of conceitfulness is compounded, since the trope is itself a product of inventive conceit and (by extension) is itself termed "a conceit."'^[*Ibid*., p. 37.] The end result of this spiral of artificiality is to reveal how the system extends in both directions: if the use of grafting as a way to describe artificiality is a conceit, then the bias towards nature is itself artificial, if not in its origin then certainly in its persistence. The maintenance of a distinction between nature and artifice---a precondition of the privileging of nature---is dependent on rhetorical and metaphorical techniques which are just as constructed as those used in an argument such as Polixenes's.


## vi. Conclusion

When *Graft and Corruption* is added to the group of non-fictional texts which have already been considered in this chapter---principally letters from Prynne---a gap seems to emerge between two styles of discourse: one which pays scrupulous attention to its own prejudices and assumptions, and another which allows itself to fall into brisk approbations and even brisker dismissals, generally of literary work which differs in some obvious respect from Prynne's own. The contradiction is similar to that which was described in Chapter 2, between Prynne's high-minded remarks on the role of prose in little magazines or worksheets such as *The English Intelligencer* and his actual practice. Yet the fact that there is such a gap, even between texts produced at roughly the same time, is important. As a necessary response to centuries of gendered and racialised violence, the prevailing culture of literature and the academic humanities in the 2010s privileges qualities such as empathy, critical self-examination and attention to difference. In this context, if all of Prynne's non-fictional prose was equally vitriolic, it might easily be written off *in toto* as lacking in contemporary relevance: less Lewis than Leavis.^[During a recent episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme 'Thinking Allowed', the philosopher Roger Scruton named Leavis as a potential counterweight to the 'Fools, Frauds and Firebrands'---a category broad enough to encompass both Jacques Lacan and Eric Hobsbawm---who, according to his eponymous book, have shaped contemporary academia ('Frauds of the left, Siblings', *Thinking Allowed*, \<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pv1g6\> [accessed 27 November 2015]). It is possible to agree with his distinction from the opposite political direction: if academic English Literature has not paid a great deal of attention to Leavis's critical prose over the last several decades, it is perhaps for good reason.] That it is in fact so heterogeneous paradoxically extends a saving umbrella over all of it, effectively guaranteeing at least the possibility of insight in even the most acid texts. It would appear important, then---if a reliable understanding of Prynne's relation to fictional prose is to be reached---to trace the outline of this gap over the necessarily vague set of supposedly positive and negative characteristics considered above. Thus, we can separate a tendency to dismiss writers by implying their exclusion from the category of sexual maturity---'pre-sexual', 'old granny'---from the question of what an aesthetic attachment to sexual maturity might actually mean; by the same token, to ascribe specific aesthetic qualities to lazy national stereotypes does not necessarily diminish the value of those qualities attributed to the speaker's own nation---in Prynne's case, soundness, solidity, effectively truth itself---though it may be difficult to disentangle them from the conceptual system in which they are set forth.

In order to provide a final assessment of the conjunction of these qualities, it will be helpful to return to the most extensive of the non-fictional prose texts mentioned so far---Prynne's January 1972 letter to Oliver. The description in this text of American poets as 'art-gallery nympholepts' has already been considered in detail; the countervailing term against which this assessment is made has not. Before turning to French and American work, Prynne notes with approval how 'the Anglo team have their teeth really sunk into pain, great physical gouts of it'. In the list of work given to support this statement, Prynne includes his own 1971 collection *Brass*; even more relevant is 1974's *Wound Response*, in which the *PTM* appears and which includes an epigraph from a 1966 scientific work, *Touch, Heat and Pain*.^[A.V.S. de Reuck and Julie Knight, eds, *Touch, Heat and Pain* (London: J. & A. Churchill, 1966). Writing to Oliver about *The Harmless Building*, Prynne remarks on '[h]ow extemely useful it was that I had some little time ago finished reading *Fundamentals of Neurology* by Ernest Gardner (a quite banal and straightforward textbook)' (Prynne to Oliver, 9, 10 and 11 January 1972).] What is it about pain as a literary subject that Prynne finds so worthy of praise? Plainly, it is related to the concern with the body discussed above. As Elaine Scarry points out, human pain is characterised by its incommunicability:

> When one hears about another person's physical pain, the events happening within the interior of that person's body may seem to have the remote character of some deep subterranean fact, belonging to an invisible geography that, however portentous, has no reality because it has not yet manifested itself on the visible surface of the earth.^[Elaine Scarry, *The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 3. The geological metaphor adopted here would no doubt appeal to Prynne.]

Yet pain is arguably also the body's most immediate mode of relation to the external environment: the most extreme form of that 'resistance' which, as Prynne discusses in *Resistance and Difficulty*, allows us to experience the world. Moreover, if *The Secret Life of Plants*---seemingly a key influence on, if not strictly a source text for, the *PTM*---is to be believed (admittedly a considerable 'if'), pain is not a sensation confined to humans, or even to the animal world. Indeed, one of the very first experiments described in detail by Tompkins and Bird involves a dragon tree supposedly reacting not just to pain, but to the threat of future pain.^[Tompkins and Bird, p. 5.] In this context, pain becomes abstracted, converted into something more like a general interface language between the living and the non-living. This chapter will conclude by suggesting that it is precisely this interface point with which Prynne is most deeply concerned in his comments on Lewis, Oliver and Upward, as well as in his own example of prose fiction, the *PTM*. What is more, it is a subject which is fundamentally linked to his views on poetic creation, as discussed in Chapter 2.

Alongside and related to the body, one of the key concerns identified above was sexual reproduction. It is difficult to think of a subject more intimately concerned with the relation between the living the non-living, involving as it does the creation of the former from the latter---or, to put it another way, the creation of a new instance of the former from two existing ones. This is the scientific field, embryology, which preoccupied Joseph Needham in the first phase of his career, before his turn to sinology following the Second World War. Katko makes clear the scientific relevance of Needham to the *PTM*, demonstrating in particular how Prynne relies on the latter's article 'Chemical Heterogony and the Ground-Plan of Animal Growth'.^[Katko, pp. 259--64. The article was published in *Biological Reviews*, 9.1 (January 1934), pp. 79--109.] Not pursued, however, is the potential connection between the 'London PTM Conference'---an explicitly interdisciplinary event, part academic and part social, concerned specifically with the meshing of biology and physics---and the Biotheoretical Gathering, a similarly focused informal research group of which Needham was a founding member. Described by Pnina G. Abir-Am as a 'scientific Bloomsbury', the Gathering---whose members, besides Needham, included C.H. Waddington, Joseph Woodger, Dorothy Wrinch and J.D. Bernal---was active throughout the mid-period of the 1930s and concerned itself with the development of a syncretic 'mathematico-physico-chemical morphology'.^[Pnina G. Abir-Am, 'The Biotheoretical Gathering, Transdisciplinary Authority and the Incipient Legitimation of Molecular Biology in the 1930s: New Perspective on the Historical Sociology of Science', *History of Science*, 25 (1987), 1--70 (pp. 9--10). The possibility of a connection between the *PTM* and the Gathering is raised negatively in a September 1974 letter from Oliver to Prynne. Describing his failed attempts to 'lift the masks'---i.e. to identify what he assumes to be the real figures behind Prynne's characters---Oliver remarks that 'Quondam Lichen seems rather too advanced for C.H. Waddington' (Prynne to Oliver, 11 September 1974).] Interest in the group's activities from the Rockefeller Foundation very nearly led to the endowment of a dedicated institute at Cambridge, but the reigning scientific authorities' personal and political antipathy towards Needham, as well as the group's threat to established disciplinary boundaries, saw the project axed.^[*Ibid*., pp. 23--26.] Nevertheless, as Abir-Am convincingly argues, the research programme of the Gathering helped make possible 'the currently dominant DNA-centred conception of molecular biology [...]. Indeed "molecular biology" surfaced as a catchier abbreviation of the lengthier and cumbersome self-description of the Biotheoretical Gathering's brief collective discourse'.^[*Ibid*., pp. 26--27. Abir-Am acknowledges that 'the Biotheoretical Gathering's projects in X-ray crystallography and biochemistry survived into the current accepted repertoire of facts and methods in molecular biology, while topology and experimental morphology did not', but points out that 'this is an outcome predicated on rather contingent policy actions in the late 1930s', principally the decision not to fund the research institute described above (*ibid*., p. 27).] There can be few clearer representatives of this 'currently dominant [...] conception' than Needham and Prynne's colleague at Caius, Francis Crick, who in 1953 was jointly responsible for the discovery of the structure of DNA itself.^[Three of the key elements of this chapter are tied together neatly in an observation that opens Timothy Materer's study of Vorticism. Discussing the vortex concept itself, he describes the influence on Ezra Pound of the theory of 'vorti-cells', as propounded by Allen Upward, Edward Upward's uncle. According to Materer, Upward 'would no doubt have considered that the discovery of the helical structure of the DNA model supported his theory' (Timothy Materer, *Vortex: Pound, Eliot, and Lewis* [London: Cornell University Press, 1979], p. 16). That this observation is taken, by ackowledgement, from p. 67 of Donald Davie's *Ezra Pound* (New York: The Viking Press, 1976) perhaps even constitutes a fourth link in the chain.] Writing to Dorn in 1978, Prynne describes a dinner with Crick and Needham, noting that '[t]here was a touch of electric collusion in the air, since the former should (& could) have succeeded the latter'; it is unclear whether he is referring to general intellectual succession or to something more prosaic such as the mastership of Caius, which had fallen from Needham to the lawyer William Wade two years earlier.^[Prynne to Dorn, 11 August 1978.] In any case, Prynne was clearly in regular contact with Crick throughout the 1970s, and appears to have maintained the view---expressed to Dorn as a newly minted fellow in 1963---that the biologist was 'something close to genius.'^[Prynne to Dorn, 22 January 1963. A third figure in the scientific milieu that supported the composition of the *PTM*, besides Needham and Crick, is Rupert Sheldrake, author of *A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance* (1981), a draft version of which was read and commented on by Prynne. Discussing the work with Dorn, Prynne says explicitly that 'Rupert was actively interested by the *content* of the Plant Time antics' (Prynne to Dorn, 18 March 1982). Prynne's and Sheldrake's early academic careers are remarkably similar, both having held the Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship at Harvard following their undergraduate degrees at Cambridge.]

One of the aspects of Crick's later research which seems to have most interested both Prynne and Dorn is the theory of panspermia: the hypothesis that life on Earth originated from microorganisms which travelled here from elsewhere in the universe, either through accidental contact with bodies such as meteoroids or through deliberate 'fertilisation' by intelligent alien life. In 1973, Crick co-authored a paper with the chemist Leslie Orgel, using 'the theorem of detailed cosmic reversibility'---'if we are capable of infecting an as yet lifeless extrasolar planet, then, given that the time was available, another technological society might well have infected our planet when it was still lifeless'---to argue for at least the possibility of the latter, a theory known as 'directed panspermia'.^[F.H.C. Crick and L.E. Orgel, 'Directed Panspermia', *Icarus*, 19 (1973), 341--46 (p. 343).] Crick later elaborated this theory in a monograph, *Life Itself: Its Origin and Nature* (1982), the publication of which prompted a letter from Prynne.^[Prynne to Francis Crick, 22 March 1982.] Here, Prynne offers an extension to the hypothesis, speculating about the potential motives of an alien civilisation which, to have reached the stage of fertilising other planets, is 'likely to have persisted in the development and satisfaction of an intense intellectual curiosity.' He points out that '[t]he far-sighted would think out the predicaments produced by instances of success [...] recognis[ing] that, in a successfully evolved colony, the question would inevitably arise there about their own origins.' Prynne's following questions are worth quoting at length:

> Would it have been completely satisfactory to leave the discovery of an indisputably extraterrestrial origin, for this sibling culture, to an extremely sophisticated interpretation of increasingly distant and fragmentary evidence (e.g. the fossil record)? Would not a good scientist of that earlier culture (from whose common genetic stock we here would, by the hypothesis, be remotely descended) not [*sic*] recognise that a later scientific curiosity would deserve to have been given evidence about its own origin, so far as this were possible, and that a good scientist does not intervene in events without leaving a record that he has done so?

What begins in the language of intellectual satisfaction here takes on an unmistakably moral tone: to leave a sign of one's intervention is the job of an implicitly god-like 'good scientist', and no more than what we, as that intervention's products, 'deserve'. Prynne thus approaches something like an ethics of interplanetary contact. The process of planetary seeding---Crick and Orgel's preferred term, a contrast to the 'infection' of undirected or accidental panspermia---is perhaps therefore analogous to horticultural grafting, an artificial transplantation of an active shoot to a passive stock. The 'good scientist' is, by the same token, a cousin of the 'good gardiner' described by George Puttenham (and cited by Prynne roughly two years before his letter to Crick), who 'by his arte will not only make an herbe, or flower, or fruite, come forth in his season without impediment, but also will embellish the same in vertue, shape, odour and taste, that nature of her selfe woulde neuer haue done.'^[George Puttenham, *The Arte of English Poesie* (London, 1589), Lib. III, "Of Ornament", Chap. XXV, pp. 253--54, quoted in Prynne, *Graft and Corruption*, p. 35.]

Indeed, the provision of readable clues is just one part of a broader implicit ethical stance characterised first and foremost by intellectual responsibility---a stance which it is tellingly easy to apply to other processes raised by the readings of Prynne's work in this and the preceding chapters. Prynne's good scientist relates to his (Prynne's pronoun) creation in a manner strikingly similar to the attitude of loving obedience described in Murdoch's 'The Idea of Perfection', and thus also to Oliver's attitude---described implicitly by Prynne---to the 'body' of *The Harmless Building*, a body which is identified partly with that of his son.^[The metaphorical furniture of the panspermia hypothesis---seeding, fertilisation, etc.---is relentless in its presentation of active male and passive female forces, to the extent that Prynne's use of the male pronoun to describe the good scientist is practically inevitable.] Whether technically omnipotent or not, the good scientist is bound by ethical strictures which are larger than himself: his creations 'deserve' certain forms of care and attention. In another sense, the good scientist provides a structural mirror for the attitude to poetic creation and the subsequent relation to the poetic object described at the end of Chapter 2. Life on Earth is like a poem, a new addition to the resistant world, and just as with a poem it is no more recuperable by its author for having been scrupulously signed and dated.^[According to Lewis, '[t]he creation of a work of art is an act of the same description as the evolution of wings on the sides of a fish, the feathering of its fins; or the invention of a weapon within the body of a hymenopter to enable it to meet the terrible needs of its life' (Lewis, *The Caliph's Design: Architects! Where is your Vortex?*, ed. by Paul Edwards (Santa Barbara, CA: Black Sparrow Press, 1986), p. 65.] The link to Prynne's implicit intervention in the so-called population debate, described in Chapter 2, is less clear, partly because the intervention itself is vague, calling for a 'rewriting' of Shelley which never actually appears. Nevertheless, it is fairly clear that Prynne's pro-procreative attitude here is at least on same the wavelength as his enthusiasm for panspermia. It is, finally, possible to link Prynne's version of the panspermia hypothesis to his comments on the value of education, considered in relation to Leavis at the end of Chapter 1. Here, it will be recalled, Prynne offers an explicitly procreative and sexual model of cultural transmission, with the father or mother's literary education allowing them to set their offspring up for their own life of intellectual curiosity, much as the good scientist anticipates the future intellectual enquiries of the denizens of a fertilised planet.

The concerns listed above relate to each other not directly but through a system of structural homology, generally based on the axis of scale. Prynne's thought shifts between levels---from the plant to the animal world, the human to the family to the aesthetic to the interplanetary---and reveals, in the process, shared structures and patterns, much as in a typological reading of scripture. This has long been recognized as a fundamental characteristic of Prynne's poetry: the first chapter of the first book-length study of his work, Reeve and Kerridge's *Nearly Too Much*, is titled 'Questions of Scale'. That it obtains similarly in the argumentative structure of his published and unpublished prose work has been less clear. Importantly, the identification of homologies is not just an *effect* of Prynne's work, but also, in some cases, its explicit subject. This is most obvious in the very text under consideration above, Prynne's March 1982 letter to Crick, which goes on to offer structural isomorphism as the condition for that deliberate sign left by the good scientist:

> what might be required could be a recognisably non-random match (say, numerical or morphological) between one part of the system and another which was functionally and causationally distant from it. Such a match would be the message in a bottle, confirming that we are survivors and not self-made.

As Katko helpfully points out, though not in reference to this particular letter, a 'non-random match' of this sort---what Needham describes as 'a system of ratios and relations, which may be possibly the same in all animals, in a word, a chemical-ground plan of animal growth'---is a key feature of the *PTM*'s biochemical hinterland.^[Needham, p. 107, quoted in Katko, p. 261.] In the letter to Crick, Prynne is more cautious, but in diligently tracing both possibilities---the presence of a message and its absence---to their various logical conclusions, he ends up revealing something more important about his basic intellectual and ethical stance:

> The first [possibility] is that messages are there and we have not found them or not noticed their significance (which ought, if efficient, to be self-confirming). The second is that they are not there. This second category divides into (a) because they were originally there but have been lost, or (b) because the original scientists attached no priority to including a message, or decided against it, or (c) because in fact there was no original scientist in our genealogy, since we ourselves are the first such in our family tree.

Prynne admits that 'these thoughts do nothing to resolve the fundamental uncertainty', and even that 'to look for a message must, I suppose, inevitably increase the possibility of deluding oneself that a message has been found'; crucially, however, he does not therefore abandon the search, concluding the letter with a re-affirmation that 'the question of a message built into the fundamental structure does strike me as one for which a small niche might be found; even if its position there were merely that of an ornament, or an irritant, or both.' This structure---the growth of a pearl of logic around a minute grain of its 'irritant' opposite (hope, free choice, the deliberate suspension of accuracy)---is absolutely characteristic of Prynne's prose, corresponding, for example, to the declaration of uncertainty which concludes 'A Note on Metal' or the act of instantiation which makes a new poem part of the world. In a version of Pascal's wager in which the prize is not heavenly but immanent, Prynne implicitly exhorts us to copy the behaviour of a good scientist who we have no proof ever existed---for it is precisely by such a circular imitation of our own projections (an idea which is by no means negatively coded), transposing them on to every level and scale of our experience, that we develop an ethics. In fact, of course, this is all we are---but it is the refusal to accept this condition which allows us finally to live in it. Writing to Dorn about Crick's *Life Itself*, Prynne quotes the author's contention that 'chance is the only source of true novelty', 'chance' being Crick's particular irritant grain. 'I tell that to the tip of my pencil, every day', continues Prynne, 'and it fills in the missing step: "chance is the main source of true boredom and only that is the source of novelty."'^[Prynne to Dorn, 18 March 1982.]
