p. 49 - 53 - it would be good if you gave a clearer sense of how this
study of prose relates to your PhD overall - eg the idea of prose
specifically as something that locates Prynne in his historical and
political context, or any other context you have in mind, and whether this
relates to the stuff about the difference between his purported
intention for prose ('evolutionary') and his practise.
  
p 56 - Do you have any particular reason for believing that Prynne is
referring to/influenced by Hegel's reading of Spinoza - is it just that
the ideas correspond?

General point: feel like you should say here that you will discuss the
piece's status as poetry-and-prose later - otherwise at around p.60 it
feels like you are reading the piece purely as an academic piece and
treating it's lacunae as errors, which I'm sure is not your intention
-maybe make clear that these lacunae are part of a more poetic or
anti-pedantic function, ... this all becomes clearer later in the chapter,
but is not clear at the time. Also, re having to 'take Prynne at his
word', due to the lacunae - could this be linked to the stuff about
Prynne's prose not being discursive and democratic in the way he claimed
earlier? feel like it all connects but the connections are left to the
reader rather than made explicit. Could talk about this around p. 62,
when you talk about 'history' as opposed to 'theory'.

p.62 last para, talking about shelley again- I found this para a bit
unclear and hard to follow, and wasn't sure how it relates to what's gone
before. Perhaps i have lost attention, but I am not sure of the trajectory
of this chapter.
  
p. 64 - starting to talk about meillasoux - again, maybe make it clearer
where you're planning to go with this, and why it is part of a chapter
that started off being about little magazines. (having read to the end,
I understand how it clarifies stuff on a note on metal; i think you
should say that your discussion will continue the argument re the status
of poetry/prose, and the deliberate status of Prynne's writing as
history.) perhaps at bthne end of the bit on  magazines you could hammer
it in more (for stupids like me) that the fact that 'a note on metal' was
published in a little magazine contributes to your understanding of it,
and helps you to read it in the way you are reading it. 

p. 66/67 - maybe say something about how/why you are using meillasoux
- there's a risk of this seeming anachronistic unless you explain in more
detail - eg, are you using meillasoux's more rigorously thought out
philosophy in order to clarify Prynne's more elliptical comments, as they
seem to share an outlook.

p.67 - the stuff on Olson's attitudes, his fideism, is hard to understand
for someone who isn't familiar with the work - could you explain in
slightly more detail what Olson's attitude is, and how is is fideistic?

p.69 '....does the text yield up its real meaning'. Again, I think you're
leaving too much up to the reader. What is its real meaning? is this
a point about reclaiming a 'left wing exilic history' through art? And
again, how does this conclusion relate to the rest of the chapter/thesis?
